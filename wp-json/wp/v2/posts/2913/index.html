These are the folks who made the camper and we are looking forward to having a couple of things repaired on it.  Just a few minutes from the manufacturer&#8217;s service department is this nice city campground.  My guess is that over half the RVers who come to this city campground are here because of NuWa service and sales.  No one can argue with the price: free for the first two nights, then just $10 a night after that.  The campsites are basically parking lot sites with 30\/50 amp electric and water.  There is a dump station on site.<\/p>\n<p>This city campground even offers free WiFi!  There are two sections.  The east side is closest to S. Santa Fe Ave. and has all pull through sites and has the good WiFi signal.  The west side sites are all back in and are close to restrooms (not well kept) and beyond the range of the WiFi.  However, the sites are a bit wider and longer.  They are also close to the dump station.  We spent one night in the eastern section and then moved to a back in spot so we could stay hooked up and be ready to report in to the service center early the next morning.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the pull through sights are are just barely wide enough for two RVs.  People who are trading RV&#8217;s park the two rigs &#8220;face to face&#8221; so they can more easily move their belongings to their new digs.  This is perhaps the only time you&#8217;ll ever see a RVer happy to have another rig parked very close by!<\/p>\n<p>While Chanute isn&#8217;t exactly a tourist destination, this is a great small town campground for a great price.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR3HKAArG6_tY-_j9DXMa-nW-fJ7f8XH9FehILC4Dz1bjyQONGEm2EGEBa-2Vv_ClVWHiXsamYqXZQ3\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/YNCyFLXxQSxEXz3K8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">See individual photos with notes here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve spent a couple of nights at Santa Fe Safari Campground in Chanute, KS as we prepare to drop our 5th wheel off for service at NuWa.
