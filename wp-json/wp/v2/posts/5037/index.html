if you book early, or a Saver Day pass which is good anywhere in Switzerland on trains and buses.\u00a0 There are a limited number of these, so, again, committing early saves money.<\/p>\n<p>I used the Trainline app for most of my train tickets.\u00a0 It works in most of Europe, including the UK.\u00a0 However, I used the Swiss rail app, SSB to get my Saver Day passes &#8211; that is the only place to get them.\u00a0 I like using the apps because they let me work in English and not have to guess the meaning of German, Italian, etc. phrases.\u00a0 Also, Trainline lets you pick your currency.\u00a0 By picking US dollars I have a better idea of what, exactly, I am spending.\u00a0 Having said all that, let me add that train travel on this trip has been among the least of our expenditures.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been constantly surprised at how low train prices are across Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The train crosses into Italy at Torino.\u00a0 We switched to an Italian train to take us to a beautiful lakeside town, Colico.\u00a0 The town is on the shore of Lake Como, a 40 mile long, very deep glacial lake which is surrounded by snowcapped mountains.\u00a0 This has been a popular vacation destination for hundreds of years.\u00a0 Right now, of course, is off season but there was still a lot of activity in the town.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow, we will continue our train journey along the shore of Lake Como back to Milan and to the airport for our flight back to Manchester.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our ride on the Bernina Express took us high up into the Swiss Alps and then down to Torino, Italy.\u00a0 The views from the train are exceptional and the route includes features like the 213 feet high Landwasser Viaduct and the Brusio spiral viaduct.\u00a0 Gaining and losing as much altitude as the train does means [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[164,166,93,115,125,165],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5037"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5037"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5037\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5075,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5037\/revisions\/5075"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5037"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5037"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5037"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
