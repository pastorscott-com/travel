Our backyard neighbors had a tree down, apparently twisted off about 10 feet up.  On the street side of the house a large pine tree was completely down, blocking the street and narrowly missing a car in a driveway.  Limbs were down, garage doors blown in, and a tree leaned against a neighbor\u2019s house.  We checked in with everyone we could find and found there were no injuries.
