There was a carnival, many vendors including local merchants, churches, and various clubs.\u00a0 We\u00a0enjoyed going through the Lions Building looking at all the arts, crafts, foods, and produce that had been judged and were on display.\u00a0 Our primary reason for being there, though, was a southern gospel concert featuring Triumphant and the Dixie Melody Boys. Even though it was windy and cool people came and enjoyed an evening of good music.<\/p>\n<p>A highlight of our sightseeing for Scott was the <a href=\"http:\/\/milan54.org\/\">Milan 54 Hoosiers Museum<\/a>\u00a0in Milan, IN.\u00a0 In 1954 the high school basketball team from this small town won the Indiana State High School basketball crown.\u00a0 In those days all schools in Indiana, of all sizes, competed in one tournament.\u00a0 As the tournament continued, Milan became a David competing against several Goliaths and ultimately won the championship by beating a team from a school over 10 times its size.\u00a0 Then, in 1986, a hit movie, \u201cHoosiers\u201d was released, based on this true life story.\u00a0 Being from a small Indiana high school, and growing up not long after the \u201cMilan miracle\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d has long been one of Scott\u2019s favorite movies.\u00a0 We spent about an hour looking at the memorabilia from players as well as items from the movie.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to all the above, we enjoyed meeting and fellowshipping with one of Scott\u2019s cousins, Pastor Paul Mingus and family.\u00a0 The cousins talked about everything from family history to theology, having a great time.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vT6WRt6Z6acy8GeyNucFt6riWDwRSMtFKorKW77yPdkRDHQyj8ehfwKr8nLI-Mn7lEkJFD9tKpVP7fL\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was fun going to the Aurora, IN Farm festival.
