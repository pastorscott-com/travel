and the logo of the wise men is everywhere.\u00a0 I thought that was pretty neat, especially on the week after Christmas.\u00a0 It isn&#8217;t unusual for hotels here to include breakfast.\u00a0 And they really mean it \u2013 we had a hearty breakfast each morning.\u00a0 That&#8217;s a real plus when you consider how expensive the eating places are.\u00a0 Fourth, when you book a hotel in Lucerne you are given free bus access.\u00a0 That&#8217;s a big savings and sets you free to explore the city.\u00a0 Finally, most everyone speaks a little English (German is the most common language).\u00a0 It never hurts to know a few common phrases.\u00a0 Even saying &#8220;Thank you&#8221; in German will bring a smile as a response.<\/p>\n<p>The highlight of our stay in Lucerne was the Lake Lucerne cruise.\u00a0 The passenger ferry boats run regular routes around the lake.\u00a0 We paid the winter day rate to give us unlimited time on the ferries.\u00a0 Honestly, that discount rate is about the same price as most round-trip tickets.\u00a0 By having a day ticket, we were able to decide just how much time we wanted to give to the cruise even while we were already underway.\u00a0 To our delight the scenery was amazing, and we opted to go for the longer route, not returning to Lucerne until after dark.\u00a0 Words can&#8217;t describe the beauty!\u00a0 We were reminded of our Alaskan cruise but also of time we spent in Colorado at Rocky Mountain National Park.\u00a0 We took tons of photos and hope you will enjoy them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Thursday, we left Milan, Italy on a high-speed train bound for Lucerne, Switzerland.\u00a0 The train was very fast, very quiet, and quite comfortable.\u00a0 Our route took us *under* the Swiss Alps.\u00a0 The Gotthard Base tunnel is the longest and deepest tunnel of its type in the world \u2013 over 35 miles long!\u00a0 When not [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[37,59,166,93,125,165],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5018"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5018"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5018\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5078,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5018\/revisions\/5078"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5018"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5018"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5018"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
