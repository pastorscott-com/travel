Colorado River being fairly close to Lake Conroe Thousand Trails is often thought of as the &#8220;quiet one.&#8221; The location is rural, there are fewer campsites and amenities. The pace feels slower.<\/p>\n<p>However, this campground is changing. Several sites have been upgraded to include 50 amps and work has just begun to add 100 new pull through sites. As I understand it the new sites will all be oversized in length and, unlike the Lake Conroe pullthroughs the new Colorado sites won&#8217;t be &#8220;back to back.&#8221; We saw the equipment brought in and some of the early dirt work on the new section which will be just beyond the pool on the east side of the main campground road.<strong> (January 2022 update: the new sites are open &#8211; there&#8217;s a $10 a night upcharge for them &#8211; the pricing for the rest of the campground is unchanged.)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This campground is also compared to Medina Lake Thousand Trails because of the deer population. The big difference is that deer feeding is allowed at Medina but not allowed here. There are plenty of deer around, but unlike at Medina they don&#8217;t approach people.<\/p>\n<p>We watched the deer, rabbits, and a neighborhood armadillo. We also had, apparently, a pocket gopher pushing up mounds of dirt in our front yard. It was kind of funny to walk out onto our rug and find a new huge mound of dirt under it like a mini-volcano had erupted over night.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the new sites going in the campground is divided up into two sections. The &#8220;A section&#8221; is comprised of three circles of campsites. The sites on the outside of the circles are more spacious that those on the inside of the circles. Many of these sites are occupied by annuals. &#8220;C and D sections&#8221; are closer to the river (although I wouldn&#8217;t consider the river to be much of an attraction). Again, there are several annual sites, but also a variety of sites, ranging from 30 amp, no sewer sites to recently upgraded 50 amp full hookup sites. I&#8217;m not sure the campground map reflects the upgrades so you might be wise to ask about that during check in.<\/p>\n<p>The campground has a cozy, but older activity center, a small pool, a small laundry, and an indoor hot tub. Kids might enjoy the mini golf, although it was rather weedy and just plain hot during our July stay.<\/p>\n<p>Our Verizon was excellent and we had no problem getting a satellite signal. Columbus is nearby with lots of fast food, a couple of grocery stores, and a soft serve ice cream place with tasty chocolate cones. If you want a bigger Walmart, there is a new one just up the road in LaGrange.<\/p>\n<p>Colorado River Thousand Trails is an easy stop just off of I10 and we recommend it for a pleasant, low-key stay.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRRMPn_i_gOueRIS3nrnxeFRdD0svAHcdgPPh44VJKfRTX2wJTBTHknJDpnbZS115-G5rrcg1f6lP8W\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our two week stay at Colorado River Thousand Trails in Columbus, Texas was a good one in spite of the Texas summer heat and our being a bit under the weather the first part of our stay.
