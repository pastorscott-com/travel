part 1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>One thing we miss when we take the camper out is our satellite TV. \u00a0I decided to bite the bullet and buy a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.winegard.com\/carryout\/\">Winegard Carryout<\/a> &#8211; a nifty automatic satellite dish. \u00a0I ordered it from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dyersonline.com\/winegard-carryout-portable-satellite-gm1518.html\">Dryersonline<\/a> and it arrived in just a few days. \u00a0When it arrived today I was anxious to try it out. \u00a0Since we don&#8217;t get to go camping as often as we like, we just take the satellite receiver out of the house and put it in the camper for our occasional trips. \u00a0To try the new Carryout out I put it in the back yard and ran the cable to the receiver in my living room.<\/p>\n<p>Since we use Dish Network, I had to open the dome and change some flip switches &#8211; it took just a few minutes to do it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/satellite\/\">Related posts are here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I had a bit of a problem getting electricity to the Carryout. \u00a0It comes with a cable that has a &#8220;cigarette lighter&#8221; plug on it. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t think that suited my needs, so I shelled out an extra $30 for an adapter. \u00a0I dutifully plugged the adapter into the wall outlet and then plugged the Carryout into it. \u00a0Nothing appeared to be happening. \u00a0I fooled with it for several minutes before I realized that the end of the cable that plugs into the Carryout felt snug but actually needed to be pushed in a bit farther. \u00a0When I heard it &#8220;click&#8221; I knew I&#8217;d found and fixed the problem. \u00a0Once the plug was all the way in, I heard the machinery go to work in the Carryout. \u00a0It takes it about three minutes to get the satellites spotted. \u00a0My first try, I had it too close to our back patio and it only found one satellite. \u00a0I moved it a bit farther out into the yard and it found all three in just a couple of minutes.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

once each time the receiver is changed from the Carryout to the house roof dish or vice versa. \u00a0So, when we head out on vacation, the first night we&#8217;ll have to go through the longer process. \u00a0After that, anytime the Carryout is moved it&#8217;ll take just three or four minutes for it to find the satellites again. \u00a0Then, at the end of the trip, as I move back to the house, I&#8217;ll have to go through the long process again.<\/p>\n<p>Now I know I could get another receiver, etc. but we just don&#8217;t get to go out enough to justify it. \u00a0Not only that, be we want to take our DVR&#8217;d shows along with us.<\/p>\n<p>The picture is every bit as good with the Carryout as with the roof mount dish. \u00a0When I went through the channels,\u00a0intentionally\u00a0going from one satellite to another, the Carryout adjusted faster than the receiver could display the new channel. \u00a0 There&#8217;s one drawback worth noting: since you can only see one satellite at a time, you can&#8217;t watch one program on one satellite live while recording another program on a different satellite. \u00a0Sooner or later that will be a problem, but certainly nothing devastating.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, so far, so good. \u00a0I&#8217;ll do another post on the Winegard Carryout once we&#8217;ve had a chance to take it on the road.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>PS: Sept 2014 Update: I used the Carryout with generally positive results.\u00a0 I had to replace the 12V plug on it (the original was of some strange design and broke easily).\u00a0 I also had to send it back for service because of my own blunder.\u00a0 When it stopped being able to lock onto satellites the factory guy said it needed to be returned for repairs.\u00a0 I opted to go with a standard satellite instead.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One thing we miss when we take the camper out is our satellite TV. \u00a0I decided to bite the bullet and buy a Winegard Carryout &#8211;
