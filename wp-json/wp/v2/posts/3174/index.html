The Island Explorer bus stopped at our campground so we had easy access to Bar Harbor and the National Park. There are many shops and eating places of all kinds around Bar Harbor. Mount Desert Island is full of history and the scenery is amazing. Again, our focus was on the national park.  Sand Beach is beautiful and I loved seeing and hearing the waves crashing in the rocks. At Jordan Pond restaurant we dined on their famous popovers with butter and jam. After eating we walked down to the pond.  The water is very clear and the view of Jordan Lake was great. The Bubble Rocks out across the Lake complete the beautiful scenery. We took one half day to drive up Cadillac Mountain to see the views that include the outer islands off in the distance. We wanted to get there early as this this a major attraction in the park and parking is limited. We arrived about nine am and not many people were there because of the fog and no view whatsoever. We looked around the gift shop and then walked on out to the ledge trail, found a comfortable spot and waited for the fog to lift. As the fog cleared the islands off in the distance and far below us came in to view.  During the winter months Cadillac Mountain is the first United States real estate to see the sun rise.  Later we drove a scenic route, exploring portions of Mount Desert that are outside of the national park.  We found a beautiful spot along Somes Sound where we enjoyed some quiet time, soaking in the beauty.  Not too far from our campground we visited a L.L. Bean Store and enjoyed looking around, even though it wasn&#8217;t the main store.  We enjoyed our experience here and can see why it has been a vacation spot for all ages through the years.  I&#8217;ll have more to write about Arcadia next week as we are going to spend the week on the Schoodic Peninsula, which some people call the &#8220;unvisited&#8221; part of Acadia National Park. <\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vS7SVRr_RffNCTNGaG-nQEZbAAG9shiqC3kBzzcigp29UNCSD4suilp5GEyZ7ljiaxs0lZjvq_843-H\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/dByX59vK5YgmNCy37\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We enjoyed our week near Bar Harbor, Maine where we focused on seeing the Mount Desert Island section of Acadia National Park.
