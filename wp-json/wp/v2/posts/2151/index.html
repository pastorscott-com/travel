Our intention was to head west to Moab, Utah and then north to Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, and then east to the Black Hills of South Dakota before turning south again in the late fall.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2037\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/clear-lake-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/>Instead, we left our winter volunteering position at San Jacinto Battlefield and Battleship Texas and drove less than 100 miles to Conroe \u2013 and then right back to the Houston area, having <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2016\/04\/24\/2016-a-different-sort-of-adventure\/\">accepted an interim pastor position<\/a> at our home church, Clear Lake Church of the Nazarene in Webster, Texas. Our stay was an enjoyable and blessed six months of ministry during the pastoral transition. We also were glad to be close to family through some challenging days. Once our time of ministry at the church was finished it was back to San Jacinto to begin another winter of helping out on Battleship Texas.<\/p>\n<p>As you can guess our <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2016\/12\/31\/2016-adventure-map\/\">2016 travel map<\/a> isn&#8217;t very impressive and our expense sheets wouldn&#8217;t be especially helpful to anyone who is looking into the fulltime RV lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>One of the neat things about this life is that we have wonderful flexibility. In small ways it is seen when we decide to change our travel plans to stay an extra day or two in a spot while we wait for better travel weather. In a big way it showed up as we scrapped an entire year\u2019s worth of travel plans to do what we felt the Lord wanted us to do.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2152\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/20160721_163430-001-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/>Moving on to a less lofty discussion, I\u2019ll mention that not having campground fees or big diesel costs this year allowed us to spend money on several extras. Some were unwelcome, like a major repair to the car; and some were purely an extravagance, like the cruise we booked. We spent money on the 5th wheel, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2017\/01\/01\/2016-end-of-the-year-expense-report\/\">taking on projects both large and small<\/a>, including buying two small recliners.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re looking forward to a return to our touring RV lifestyle in 2017. In the early spring we plan on heading to the southeastern part of the country, then we\u2019ll head north looking for cooler summer temperatures, and then we may try for the Black Hills again in the fall.<\/p>\n<p>Those are our plans. That is, unless the phone rings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Things didn&#8217;t go for us as planned in 2016.
