pedestrian signal.\u00a0 After 11:00 or so at night traffic calmed down and people stopped pushing the &#8220;wait to cross&#8221; button.\u00a0 Still, it was a rather noisy place to stay and we didn&#8217;t sleep well either night that we were there.<\/p>\n<p>After arriving in Galway we headed across Eyre Square and into the Latin Quarter.\u00a0 We window shopped and people watched, stretching our legs after the train ride.\u00a0 There were buskers playing and singing to the crowds.\u00a0 Nearby we found the Spanish Arch and Wall, which are hundreds of years old.\u00a0 Later on we went into a shopping mall and saw that part of that wall has been preserved inside the mall!<\/p>\n<p>The next morning we walked just a few minutes to the pickup point for our bus tour.\u00a0 This is an all day tour that features the Cliffs of Moher and other destinations to the south of Galway along the coast.\u00a0 There are other tours and I wish we had had the time to take them, but I think this one is considered the major one and I&#8217;m glad we took it.\u00a0 Highlights included a look at Dunguarie Castle, Aillwee Cave (with a nice underground waterfall), a rocky area called the Burren, and the Cliffs of Moher.\u00a0 The route follows part of the Wild Atlantic Way \u2013 a scenic drive along the ocean.\u00a0 This area is very popular with both locals and tourists.\u00a0 Many festivals take place in the small towns along the way and during the summer the area is packed with visitors.<\/p>\n<p>The main draw for us was the Cliffs of Moher.\u00a0 There are wide, paved trails up onto the cliffs.\u00a0 However, you can also ask for a lift on a golf cart (called the &#8220;Lifts of Moher&#8221;).\u00a0 We opted for that and a driver cheerfully took us up to two different overlooks.\u00a0 I have to say that we stayed a shorter time than we would have liked because of the cold, strong wind!\u00a0 As I understand it, it is quite common so if you make the trip, check the weather conditions on the Cliffs.<\/p>\n<p>We hopped a national bus the next morning for a two hour trip to Shannon Airport.\u00a0 That airport was the exact opposite of Manchester Airport.\u00a0 Shannon was quiet and laid back.\u00a0 Our trip through security was just a formality and our plane left pretty much on time.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say our visit to Ireland give us just a taste of the island.\u00a0 It is interesting to consider that if we were coming to Ireland from the states the airfare would be hundreds of dollars more than what we spent for the short hop across the Irish Sea.\u00a0 When you spend more you want to stay long enough to feel you have received value for the cost.\u00a0 In our case, we just did a long weekend.\u00a0 We saw less, but then again we spent considerably less.\u00a0 I guess everything in life has its tradeoffs.\u00a0 Long stay or short, we do recommend Ireland as an interesting and beautiful destination.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part two of our quick trip to Ireland began with a Sunday afternoon high speed train trip from Dublin to Galway.\u00a0 We really enjoy train travel (evidenced by our big train trip to Italy and the Swiss Alps).\u00a0 The trains are fast and reasonably quiet.\u00a0 They are also reasonably priced.\u00a0 We enjoyed the two-hour trip [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[167,93,115,125,147],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5070"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5070"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5070\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5073,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5070\/revisions\/5073"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5070"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5070"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5070"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
