I&#8217;d say it is more common than not that we have to do some minor leveling.\u00a0 However, if we have to do some major leveling effort we will try a different site if possible.\u00a0 If a significant number of sites are the same we will camp elsewhere in the future.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Too expensive:<\/strong> Again, location matters. Nice parks in popular areas can charge more and we will pay it. However, we have found that paying more doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean getting more.\u00a0 If we think a place is overpriced we shop around.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Hard to navigate:<\/strong> Our rig is big enough that we sometimes have trouble driving it through a campground with narrow, twisting roads. We also need room to back in to a site without having other RVs, trees, etc. complicating the process.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve owned all kinds of camping gear \u2013 from tents up to our current motorhome and I know how to park a RV.\u00a0 At the same time, I don&#8217;t like having to fight my way into a spot.\u00a0 In some cases this is campsite specific, if not, I&#8217;ll mark that RV Park off my list.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Neighbors too close:<\/strong> I know that urban, private RV Parks tend to pack people in as close as possible. It may be that, because of location I&#8217;ll put up with tight quarters for a week or so.\u00a0 However, we generally avoid &#8220;parking lot campgrounds.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Noisy location:<\/strong> For some reason RV Parks seem to end up near active railroad tracks or nestled up against busy Interstates and Freeways. Again, for shorter stays we will grin and bear it.\u00a0 For longer stays, no thanks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By and large, we are happy campers who love the RV lifestyle.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t need to stay in high dollar resorts to be happy and we generally roll with the punches.\u00a0 Still, we&#8217;ve stayed in a few places that we aren&#8217;t likely to visit again.<\/p>\n<p>How about you?\u00a0 What would you add to this list?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here are seven reasons we mark a campground or RV Park off our list as a potential camping location.\u00a0 These are listed in decreasing order of importance to us: We feel unsafe: Uncared for trailers with lots of people hanging around them, late night yelling and roaring car engines, etc. We&#8217;ll leave ASAP and not [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[4,22,101],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4761"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4761"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4761\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4763,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4761\/revisions\/4763"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4761"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4761"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4761"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
