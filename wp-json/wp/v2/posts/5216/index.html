We enjoyed our year there; especially making many great friends at the college, where we lived and volunteered, and at Longsight Community Church of the Nazarene, where we worshipped. <\/p>\n<p>We took full advantage of the travel opportunities available to us, with visits to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/ireland\/\">Ireland<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/netherlands\/\">Netherlands<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/scotland\/\">Scotland<\/a>, and the great attractions local to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/uk\/\">Manchester<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In June we said farewell to our friends in the UK and returned to Houston for an entirely different sort of Adventure.  After looking at serval houses we settled on one &#8211; but with a bit of concern about various projects that would need doing fairly soon.<\/p>\n<p>The next day, a different listing became available.  One look at this house and we felt it was &#8220;the one!&#8221;  A bit of negotiating and we signed on the dotted line &#8211; after years of fulltime RVing and then a year in England we had a &#8220;stix and brix&#8221; place of our own.  <\/p>\n<p>As I said, &#8220;what a year it was!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While we are happy with our new house we still have the itch to do some traveling.  Our New Year will start with a Carribean cruise and there are a few other things on the horizon.  <\/p>\n<p>We know we are blessed in every way.  Thanks for following along.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We started the New Year in Switzerland! It was a wonderful trip.
