We take those clothes out and hang them wet and run the second load all the way to dry. Then we dry the first load. With the drum already hot the second dry load goes a lot faster and we can often just use the 20 minute dry-only cycle to finish up the clothes from the first load.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, we do one load a day; having to do an extra one a time or two a week.\u00a0 On the setting we use most often it takes about two hours to do a complete wash\/dry cycle.\u00a0 (Remember, we&#8217;re doing this on 110 volts.)\u00a0 Speaking of electric, on a 30 amp hookup we have to be careful or we throw the breaker at the power pedestal. \u00a0 If we leave everything else off we can generally get by with leaving the a\/c on plus the Splendide.\u00a0 On a 50 amp hookup we can pretty much run it all without any problem.<\/p>\n<p>We have experimented a bit with using the washer when we don&#8217;t have a sewer hookup.\u00a0 Starting with an empty gray water tank we could do around four loads before filling up.\u00a0 We had one stay in which we were without sewer and knew that our next stop would also be without sewer.\u00a0 We &#8220;prepared&#8221; for that by using the campground showers and then, the day before our move we ran laundry a good part of the day, managing to get much of our laundry caught up before we dumped all tanks the next morning.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4755 \" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide-1024x616.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide-1024x616.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide-300x181.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide-768x462.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide-1536x924.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/splendide.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px\" \/>We already get a bit of shaking when a person walks up and down the stairs, etc. in the camper and when the Splendide goes into spin mode the shaking is quite noticeable.\u00a0 Loose cabinet doors rattle and I get a bit of a massage if I&#8217;m sitting in my chair.\u00a0 We consider it to just be part of the RVing lifestyle.\u00a0 After all, our house is sitting on springs!<\/p>\n<p>Overall, we love this unit and highly recommend it.\u00a0 If we had it to do over again, we would still make this one of our first purchases.
