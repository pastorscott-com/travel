In my case, this is a &#8220;rest&#8221; sabbatical.  That means I&#8217;m not out here to work on a book or to take a course at some seminary or even to climb some &#8220;holy mountain&#8221; in search of an encounter with God.  To say it more simply, I&#8217;m on an extended, month long vacation.  That isn&#8217;t to say I don&#8217;t want a renewal of spirit but my goal is to let that happen in mostly unintentional ways.  Some of the personal spiritual things that I do all the time, like writing devotionals, have been laid aside and I haven&#8217;t added anything aside from writing this journal.   I also brought one book by CS Lewis for some more intense reading and another Christian fiction book.  I&#8217;m going to keep this journaling going and then take a much more low key approach to spiritual things, just letting things flow in a relaxed state.  If I come away from this sabbatical feeling rested and refreshed I&#8217;ll consider it a success.  Anything else will be a bonus.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So what does a pastor do on a sabbatical? In my case, this is a &#8220;rest&#8221; sabbatical.
