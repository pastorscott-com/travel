This visit was just for a week, so we had a short but busy stay. A highlight for us was the opportunity to attend the Saturday afternoon sessions of the National Quartet Convention at the LeConte Center in Pigeon Forge. Thanks to some friends who were attending the convention, we got tickets for the Gerald Wolfe Hymn Sing. This was a fun &#8220;sing along&#8221; event with a full choir and several other southern gospel singers. Then, we attended a concert featuring several male quartets.  As you can guess Scott was right in his element and I enjoyed my first NQC.<\/p>\n<p>We spent one day enjoying the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Years ago we spent some time camping at Cades Cove and we haven&#8217;t been back there since.  It was as pretty as we remembered.  We took the scenic loop drive, stopping at three historical spots along the way. Our first stop was at the Primitive Baptist Church.  We could see the space where the heating stove sat and the roof vent where the stovepipe vented outside. There is a large cemetery in back and we could see some the names and dates of the people buried there. One thing that stuck me in both cemeteries was the amount of children\u2019s graves; especially those that died on the day of their birth. I was surprised to see several more recent graves there, apparently family plots still being used by families to lay loved ones to rest. <\/p>\n<p>We also stopped at a Methodist Church.  The building has an old upright piano. As we arrived a young lady was playing the piano and after she left Scott played his trademark \u201cWhen the Saints go Marching In.\u201d  Several came in as he played and they asked for an encore!  Scott said this was his day of fame! It really did sound good in that old church.<\/p>\n<p>We stopped at the visitors&#8217; center to eat our picnic lunch and then walked around the historic farm there. Next month the National Park Service will be using the historic equipment on site to demonstrate how to make sorghum which they have on sale in the store. The house is large with several rooms on the main floor and an upstairs. We also saw an old barn, corn crib, and a working mill where a man was grinding corn into cornmeal. The mill wheel was turned by water from a nearby stream.  We loved the drive through the park that follows a beautiful mountain stream that features many impressive rapids.  We thoroughly enjoyed our day in the beauty of God\u2019s Creation.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much to see in this area that it would take months to really do it justice.  We enjoyed returning to the Apple Barn for a meal as well as exploring the shops there.  We&#8217;ll look forward to future visits here.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQldAG3Jhy7iw3wOrYQsdcLpCDeN5Db7TctgZbI4mPQf5QsGBgRECrlCDxIUWNwr_c5s35cxgPprf7a\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/KKW63wYcRFWf7DBeA\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We always enjoy returning to the Smoky Mountains.
