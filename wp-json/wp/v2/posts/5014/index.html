I think everyone was touring like us, although a few people had shopping bags, so some people were there to actually shop!<\/p>\n<p>The heart of Milan is the huge <strong>Duomo Cathedral<\/strong>. The church dates back to the 1300&#8217;s and construction continued on the building over 600 years!\u00a0 One feature not to be missed is the rooftop tour!\u00a0 By going up on top you get a more close up view of the amazing architecture of the building.\u00a0 There are statues, latticework, and spires everywhere.\u00a0 It is amazing to me that statues would be placed in areas that could never be seen from the ground.\u00a0 We took the elevator up but ended up climbing up and down many stairs as we followed the route up higher and higher.\u00a0 Of course, the views of the city are magnificent.\u00a0 Then, even from the roof top there are still more spires towering high above.\u00a0 The inside of the building is amazing too.\u00a0 This ancient church seats 40,000 worshippers!\u00a0 It seems that every square inch of the interior is carved, decorated, etc.\u00a0 There are stained glass windows everywhere, including some huge windows made up of smaller windows that tell the story of the Bible.<\/p>\n<p>After finishing up our tour of the church we hopped on the subway to visit the <strong>Piazza Gae Aulenti<\/strong>.\u00a0 Visiting this ultra-modern shopping area after exploring the Cathedral nearly gave us &#8220;architectural whiplash!&#8221;\u00a0 From an ancient building we found ourselves surrounded by the latest, most modern buildings you can imagine.\u00a0 The Christmas market was still in operation, and there was a giant &#8220;tree&#8221; constructed of snow sleds.\u00a0 It was very interesting.\u00a0\u00a0 In the near distance there are two &#8220;forest&#8221; sky scrapers.\u00a0 These big apartment buildings are covered with trees!<\/p>\n<p>For meals we had mostly pasta.\u00a0 One night I had a pizza that was quite good.\u00a0 The next night I had lasagna that was even better.\u00a0 Jackie loved the Alfredo with mushrooms she had one meal.\u00a0 I enjoyed a coffee they have called a macchiato.\u00a0 It is similar to a latte but somehow better.\u00a0 It seems that there are coffee shops and pizzerias on every corner.<\/p>\n<p>I think we could have continued sightseeing Milan a few more days.\u00a0 It is an interesting and fun place to visit.\u00a0 If you come, don&#8217;t miss the Cathedral rooftop or the &#8220;Last Supper.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The day after Christmas we boarded an EasyJet flight from Manchester to Milan, Italy for our first visit to Italy and then Switzerland.\u00a0 Air fares are quite good around Europe, and we didn&#8217;t want to miss the chance to do some exploring.\u00a0 As we approached Milan we could see the Alps (Italian or Swiss?) down [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[59,164,166,90,115,125],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5014"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5014"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5014\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5079,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5014\/revisions\/5079"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5014"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5014"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5014"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
