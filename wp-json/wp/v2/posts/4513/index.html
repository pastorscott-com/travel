Not only did the Coronavirus throw a monkey wrench into everyone&#8217;s plans, but we also filled in as an interim pastor at a local church.  That position also lasted longer than expected.  <\/p>\n<p>Green Caye is a RV residential campground with lots of working people and permanent residents.  The property is well cared for with a responsive maintenance staff.\u00a0The grass is mowed on a regular basis and problems, in general, are taken care of in a timely way.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are no activities most of us associate with &#8220;camping.&#8221;  This is a place where people &#8220;live&#8221; in RVs and there is nothing &#8220;recreational&#8221; about it.<\/p>\n<p>There are some nice walking areas on the property.  The longer route circles a now-closed par 3 golf course that has been converted into cattle pasture land.  The shorter route circles a retention pond that is well populated with ducks, both domestic and wild.<\/p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;ve written other reviews and posted lots of photos through the years, my photos feature the many pretty sunsets we enjoyed during our evening walks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/green-caye\/\">Other Green Caye Reviews are here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRJu-p091zcrtLsz120AijI0oGMfJfg4ies-03YXvSBuee4cc6WKtgq37aMgXKgNbUAOmIHWX1m-zMb\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve been at Green Caye RV Park in Dickinson, TX several times through the years so we pretty much know what to expect when we arrive.\u00a0 Some of our favorite spots are in the cul-de-sacs of the campground.\u00a0 There&#8217;s a bit of a community feel in these areas of the campground.\u00a0 \u00a0Most of the people [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[22,159,115,133],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4513"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4513"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4513\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4582,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4513\/revisions\/4582"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4513"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4513"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4513"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
