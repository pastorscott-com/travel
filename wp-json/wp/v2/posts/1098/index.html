The fulltime philosophy and common sense approach is evident everywhere from the wide, paved roads to the excellent and much used activity center.<\/p>\n<p>The property has no pool or spa and reservations are not accepted. Escapees facilities are famous for always finding a place for a traveler to park their RV even it has to temporarily be a spot with no hookups. The activity center has a large meeting room with a full-sized commercial kitchen, a large library, a workout room with modern equipment, and a crafts room. There&#8217;s also a nice porch with a view of the valley below and the Dragoon Mountains. This view is especially pretty at sunset.<\/p>\n<p>If you get the idea that I like this place you are 100% right!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We loved it at the Escapees SKP Saguaro Co-Op in Benson, AZ.
