However, our stays haven&#8217;t been in the heat of August.  The afternoon heat has been brutal at times.  Still, we&#8217;ve enjoyed some pretty sunsets over the lake and also some nice evenings.  There were plenty of available campsites when we arrived although the campground filled up over the weekend.  The Activity Center is closed and the pool is operating on a limited basis because of the pandemic.  Because of the weather and the health related limitations I wouldn&#8217;t rate this stay as one of our better ones.  Still we like Lake Conroe.  It is one of our favorite Thousand Trails.
