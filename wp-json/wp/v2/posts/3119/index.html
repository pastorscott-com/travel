Really, the area has enough to offer to make a longer stay tempting.  However, for us, this is a bit more pricey stay than we are used to.  No doubt, Thousand Trails has spoiled our bank account!  <\/p>\n<p>The campground is a former KOA and is close to I80 but I don&#8217;t think we could hear the traffic at all.  There are several pull-through sites tiered on a hill as well as a number of longer term back in sites plus many seasonal spots in the trees on the north side of the campground.  Our pull-through site was level and utilities convenient.  The WiFi was good.  I have to admit that the higher price, in this case, resulted in a superior campground.<\/p>\n<p>The primary feature is a small, but pretty lake that is filled with bluegill.  We watched several fishermen catching and releasing small fish as fast as they could reel them in, re-bait, and cast.  We got a kick out of watching one little guy, about three years old, catch his first fish.  The campground has fishing gear to loan to anyone who wants to get in of the fun.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday the campground was full and there were activities for campers of all ages with wagon rides, a corn-hole contest, and other events.  Then, since we were still close to Independence Day there was a fireworks show over the lake.  <\/p>\n<p>I had no problem getting my satellite TV signal and my Verizon data was good.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ6xNsB4pWwSSDAg-Io2fb88hyOgAPHdEvKV_MhEUyfs_HCHco7XYZ8sNXnMY95pfHJUiWwyQzAJDEB\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/t2EPK7RVgn9mcN6X8\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our stay at Woodland Campground, near Clearfield, PA, was for just four nights.
