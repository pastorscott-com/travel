Inside the Museum are galleries with dioramas, written and archeological information about the era, and movies and other multi-media telling the stories of both the Americans and the British during the struggle for freedom. I enjoyed the interactive exhibits and the videos.  I especially liked the theater where I felt I was in the battle itself with smoke in the air and the feeling of the concussion of canon blasts.<\/p>\n<p>Outside, we visited the Continental Army encampment with costumed soldiers and women who talked about their daily lives. We saw musket demonstrations and  the firing of a cannon. We  also toured a Revolution-Era farm with docents in costumes who talked to us about life on the farm. There is a farmhouse with separate kitchen, a tobacco barn with tobacco hanging in the rafters, and slave quarters. <\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed our visit to the American Revolution Museum and came away with a greater appreciation for our heritage of freedom.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSJBWys3yzSeVRVo08f_sbXgOSlkzYKIy-mBVIjcZ6u6Z0NHcet8wjMZWFH3coe8rk5MKPdZckehzKg\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The American Revolution Museum at Yorktown, VA is a great place to refresh your memory and learn about the formation of our nation.
