It is located on Lake Eufaula in beautiful eastern Oklahoma, about 10 miles south of I40, just off of Highway 69.  This campground has a lot going for it.  Most of the campsites offer a lake view, in fact, a many of the sites are along the lake.  We were in a section of good pull throughs that are long enough for any rig, and right along the lake.  These sites are quite popular, so it might be a challenge to just arrive and snag one of them.  There are also several spots that would be ideal for smaller rigs, each right on the water.  <\/p>\n<p>The soil is sandy here, so there are plenty of sandy beach areas.  The sand, though, is also a negative for the campground due to considerable erosion caused by flooding over the past few years.  <\/p>\n<p>None of the campsites have a sewer connection.  Many are water and electric, although not all have water.  The section we were in had 50 amp electric service.  While most of the sites seemed reasonably level, I noticed that a few were obviously sloping toward the lake.   I had to do some leveling back to front, but, in general, our site was quite good.  In fact, I&#8217;d say that this may have been our prettiest campsite of the year.<\/p>\n<p>Our Verizon signal was good and, since aiming at the satellite was out over the lake, there was no problem seeing the satellites.<\/p>\n<p>This is an outstanding campground for those traveling north and south on Highway 69 or east and west on I 40.  <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR0ca8Udwo9pfvJu5DyBGm-Z79oKN6nCDumMF_GF3yXOjEkpZVaqRNBcneOaISLShVjRS1d26gtX2ln\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Belle Starr CoE is another great Corps of Engineers campground.
