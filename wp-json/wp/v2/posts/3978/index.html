We started at the visitor center where we watched a short overview of our National Anthem and how it came to be written by Francis Scott Key. The visitors&#8217; center also has interactive displays and historical artifacts to see.<\/p>\n<p>There are Ranger talks scheduled throughout the day. We joined one and learned about the War of 1812 while we walked along.  Our presenter described the cannons and their range and the various types of ammunition. He led us into the Fort and up a small incline to point out to us approximately where the British fleet was positioned in the harbor. Francis Scott Key&#8217;s ship was being detained by the British out in the harbor. There he watched through the night to see if the flag was still flying over the fort. It was a fascinating and wonderful learning experience.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSBoPtM9gm4gmVPMcAN_H9EwTqmSTjJYTQ_Yv_jBJo6rtvw6ezc7hTYa_TBXOSrE5X8PaKvp_wXHwjX\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sight and Sound &#8211; Lancaster, PA<\/strong><br \/>\nWe attended a production of \u201cJesus\u201d at the Sight and Sound Theater.  This amazing presentation is based on events of the life of our Lord.  There are flashbacks of his birth and his experience at the Temple when he was 12 years old as the story takes the audience through the ministry of Jesus.  The presentation uses live actors, music, song, moving scenery, and live animals to bring these events to life. The 300 foot stage wraps around the audience. There are humorous scenes and powerful drama that reminds us of how much He loves us even to the point of laying down his life for us. The resurrection and ascension scenes are breathtaking. All of this was done concluding with an opportunity for anyone to invite Jesus to be a part of their life here and now.  No photography is allowed, but we took a couple of photos just to help us remember this powerful presentation.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQDvFG2KysrqySS2hbwHxKNDJg1BejwKZA-qbqBGLd5JXMnR_PzsxUOIE8esVlqjc4DkFWY08-Y_446\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tabernacle in the Wilderness &#8211; Lancaster, PA<\/strong><br \/>\nAt the Mennonite Information Center in Lancaster PA we saw a full scale replica of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. Our tour guide gave us the Biblical background of the Israelites and we saw replicas of the altar of sacrifice and basin used in the outer court and then we moved into a room where we saw a replica of the inner court with actual color curtains, candlestick, and table of bread. There is a full-size wax figure dressed as the high priest so we could see the stones on the breast plate and the miter. The curtain separating the Holy of Holies is there but we were able to look through windows to see the replica Ark of the Covenant.  Overall it was a very inspiring time and it helped me clarify my understanding of the tabernacle in the wildernesses.<\/p>\n<p>The Lancaster, PA area is a real tourist mecca.  We will see much more in the week to come, but it will be family time for us as well, so our focus will be on family rather than doing a sightseeing blog.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fort McHenry, Baltimore, MD &#8211; and the Star Spangled Banner Our drive down to Fort McHenry in Baltimore MD was a fun but hot day.
