Interestingly enough, the store is in Georgia while the campground and service department is across the parking lot and in Tennessee!  I don&#8217;t think anyone would consider this campground to be a destination campground.  The sites are quite narrow and the campground has a generally tired feeling about it.  And it is urban camping: a motel parking lot was across the tall chain link fence by our rig.  The restrooms were clean but the pool wasn&#8217;t open yet for the summer.  Surprisingly, it looks as though there are a few long term residents here (let me mention, though, that all the sites were clean, etc.)  People come to the campground to await getting service done on their RVs and to take advantage of the low price during a visit to the tourist town that is Chattanooga.  We saw one happy camper moving from their old RV into a new one that had been parked facing them in the neighboring campsite.  I saw elsewhere that if you renew your Good Sam membership at the store (which is where you register) that camping fees were waved.  I asked, and we got the same deal &#8211; not just for one night, but for both nights of our stay.  Our Verizon signal was very good and I had a clear view of the sky for satellite reception (although cable TV was available at each site).  We arrived in late afternoon and all the 50 amp sites were taken.  The second day many of them were open into the evening. If you are visiting Chattanooga, don&#8217;t mind a crowded campground, and are okay with taking your chances on getting a spot, you might want to keep this place in mind.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRj_z6NjIg6sYckQRjMm4CQCZ4zOF7TfDX10OLlQsJGDpcjNX5gAlmCbKTLm5axjNVxo4e92gxdH7_g\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This campground is operated by Camping World in Chattanooga.
