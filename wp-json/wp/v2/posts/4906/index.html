here) is less than 10 minutes away.\u00a0 There are lots of shops ranging from restaurants to two butchers to a green grocer.\u00a0 So far our favorite place to eat is the carry out (&#8220;take away&#8221;) fish and chips place.\u00a0 But we&#8217;re still very early in our time here and there are plenty of eating places to check out.\u00a0 Our main place to catch the bus is in front of the fish place but depending on where we are headed, we might want to walk a different direction to catch other busses going to different areas of the city.<\/p>\n<p>People are walking everywhere.\u00a0 From what I can tell, this has little to do with the excellent weather.\u00a0 In spite of all the cars and traffic, the great public transit encourages people to walk rather than drive.\u00a0 A surprising number of people don&#8217;t own a car or even have a driver&#8217;s license.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the biggest difference so far as the roadways are concerned is that people drive on the left side of the road.\u00a0 You&#8217;d think that since we are walking that that wouldn&#8217;t matter to us.\u00a0 However, every time we cross the road we have to be sure to check the traffic in the right direction.\u00a0 In fact, &#8220;right direction&#8221; is just the way to think about it!\u00a0 Look to the right for traffic.\u00a0 Honestly, I feel like a 6 year old being given permission to cross the street alone.\u00a0 I look back and forth about 4 times before I hurry across the street.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft \" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEj35uToQPLYyRHyNS9hwR4OJBA5c6H15H79wmLBg1inF2OU5-RRnwDFG_PNUdJFDF5qLZFDx42JgaIx34HoISi4mGxYK_hctiVibNYsDSz_NjazGHqvBkPU67vghj9vNLrtMalxpjooeNCy-8s_CSbC6fnJvPxsWgWqxBsmjBw3s8kYvblQUWCzDTn09A\/s4032\/20220729_151053.jpg\" width=\"413\" height=\"232\" \/>Aside from the number of people walking and having to be aware of traffic the other thing we&#8217;ve noticed is the presence of sidewalks on both sides of the road just about everywhere.\u00a0 Sidewalks are called &#8220;the pavement&#8221; here, and it is unusual for a roadway to not have sidewalks on both sides.\u00a0 Judging by the number of pedestrians it makes perfect sense.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned, we&#8217;re in a nice area here so I&#8217;m sure that things aren&#8217;t just like our neighborhood everywhere.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re now in the second week of our UK Adventure.\u00a0 Jackie has started volunteering in the Library.\u00a0 My involvement begins with some minor stuff later on.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve either been busy trying to get settled in or laying low, resting up from it all.\u00a0 I generally do a lot of walking for exercise but today was [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[101,125,162,147],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4906"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4906"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4906\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5093,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4906\/revisions\/5093"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4906"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4906"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4906"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
