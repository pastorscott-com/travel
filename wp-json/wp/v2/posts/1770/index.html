This is a beautiful area overseen by the National Park service. We spent part of one day in the town of Munising, MI, where we visited a waterfall, the beach, and a maritime museum. The self-righting Coast Guard boat there was interesting. The view from the beach was lovely. There is a lot of driftwood up and down the beaches. It would be a nice place to picnic and relax, however it was cool and very windy on the day we visited. We came back another day to hike a little and take the Pictured Rocks boat tour. We enjoyed our hike to Miners Falls and a shorter hike to the Miners Castle overlook. From there we picked up our tickets for the two hour cruise.<\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed the cruise very much. We saw the lighthouse on Grand Isle, many beaches, and rock formations including an arch and a cave with water dripping into the lake. The Pictured Rocks and Spray Falls were the highlight of the tour. We hope to come to this area again and spend more time hiking and looking around.<br \/>\nWe also spent time on Lake Michigan at Manistique, MI. We took a scenic walk on a boardwalk and out to the East Breakwater Lighthouse. We enjoyed this nice walk on a sunny day with the sound of the waves all around. Manistique has lots of small shops here and plenty of restaurants and sandwich shops.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff The highlight of our stay in the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan was time spent at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior at Munising.
