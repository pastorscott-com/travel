I guess you&#8217;d say we get the best of both worlds here.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013-TT-Lake-Conroe.34.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013-TT-Lake-Conroe.34-300x169.jpg\" width=\"320\" \/><\/a>Aside from the overnight trip home when we first bought our Nu-Wa Hitchhiker this is our first time out with this camper so it&#8217;s been somewhat of a shake down cruise.&nbsp; Jackie and I have both been working on one little project or another most of the time we&#8217;ve been here so time has passed quickly.&nbsp; Still, it&#8217;s nice to get away to a different world for a few days.<\/p>\n<p>An inlet from Lake Conroe is accessible here at the preserve.&nbsp; While there are no campsites right on the lake, it is nearby.&nbsp; In the summer there are canoes and paddle boats.&nbsp; It has been too cool to use the pool but it&#8217;s a beauty.&nbsp; We were tempted to try the spa.&nbsp; The hot water would have felt good, but we couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of getting out, all wet in the cool weather.&nbsp; Maybe we&#8217;ll try it next time.<\/p>\n<p>The WiFi signal is pretty good but it&#8217;s very slow.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been using my 4G connect instead &#8211; it&#8217;s quite good. <\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Again, we like this place and will most certainly be back.&nbsp; We recommend Thousand Trails Lake Conroe!<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013-TT-Lake-Conroe.25-002.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" border=\"0\" height=\"180\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013-TT-Lake-Conroe.25-002-300x169.jpg\" width=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve taken a few days off to get out in our Hitchhiker II LS 5th wheel and have been at Thousand Trails Lake Conroe, just north of Houston.&nbsp; Our first couple of days here were overcast and cool with light rain, but things turned around on Wednesday afternoon and we&#8217;ve had pretty days with cold [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1298,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[22,75],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1195"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4636,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1195\/revisions\/4636"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1195"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1195"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1195"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
