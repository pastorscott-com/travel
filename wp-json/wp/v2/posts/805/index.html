This is a mobile home park that has converted some of the spots into RV sites. The streets are wide and the sites are the size of a mobile home site &#8211; in other words, pretty big. The park itself is just minutes off of I15 and there are several fuel stops and fast food restaurants nearby. The restroom\/shower is actually a manufactured home that is being used for this purpose &#8211; in other words, using the restroom or shower is like using one at someone&#8217;s house. There&#8217;s one especially nice feature &#8211; it&#8217;s the view to the east. I&#8217;ll include a photo of that view here &#8211; sorry to say our stay was brief and I didn&#8217;t get any other photos.If you need an overnight stop this one will do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff Our stop in North Ogden, UT was just a couple of nights.
