This is a mobile home park that has converted some of the spots into RV sites.  The streets are wide and the sites are the size of a mobile home site &#8211; in other words, pretty big.  The park itself is just minutes off of I15 and there are several fuel stops and fast food restaurants nearby.  The restroom\/shower is actually a manufactured home that is being used for this purpose &#8211; in other words, using the restroom or shower is like using one at someone&#8217;s house.  There&#8217;s one especially nice feature &#8211; it&#8217;s the view to the east.  I&#8217;ll include a photo of that view here &#8211; sorry to say our stay was brief and I didn&#8217;t get any other photos.If you need an overnight stop this one will do.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQsmqZj_wRw3bInj651v-NZ-CVV254HzEnGE0QL3NKdPdybxA9KOO_blHsTw5Qc-SL9ZAu3f53WqG1v\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our stop in North Ogden, UT was just a couple of nights.
