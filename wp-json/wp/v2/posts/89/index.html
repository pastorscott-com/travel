We were just here in February when we took a short shake down trip with our camper.  This is such a nice place.  There\u2019s an inlet of Lake Conroe right here on the property and lots of campsites.  Some of the roads are gravel, but others are paved, although the pavement is in considerable need of repair.  We\u2019re camped right next to the big pool and large heated jacuzzi.  The park is well laid out with the Activity Center, pool, tennis courts, and more right in the middle of the park.  The Hidden Cove area is a neighborhood of permanent, small cabins.  There\u2019s also a neighborhood of long term residents and another area pretty much dominated by seasonal people.<\/p>\n<p>With all of that, there\u2019s plenty of full hookup sites for short term visitors like us.  There\u2019s WiFi but it\u2019s not that great.  We have a five bar connect but it\u2019s still sluggish at best.  My Verizon 4G, though, is 3 bars and not bad at all.  We\u2019re in a 30 amp site, but for an extra $3 there are plenty of 50 amp sites available.  When we were here in February we went to a Valentine\u2019s dinner at the Activity Center.  A talented fellow played the keyboard and the steak dinner was very good.  Now, though, we\u2019re into May and most of the seasonal people have headed north.  We went to a scheduled potluck and were out of luck, as no one showed up.  It think the lack of attendance was due to the number of departures coupled with a local tragedy that resulted in the death of one of the long time residents.  Nearly every \u201clong timer\u201d we talked to mentioned it.  I think that speaks well of the sense of community here.  The park has it\u2019s share of trees, but not so much that there\u2019s any problem getting satellite TV.  Also, our rooftop antenna is sufficient for us to get most of the Houston TV stations.  I think most of the area attractions are Houston oriented; around 40 to 60 minutes to the south.  Since Houston has been local to us for the past many years we\u2019re not inclined to fight the traffic so our time here is more being used for decompression from the intense events of our lives the past few weeks.  That\u2019s okay with us but we are starting to think about the next parts of our big adventure.<\/p>\n<p>Let me also mention that just a few minutes from the preserve, on Little Egypt Road, is John Burge Park. It\u2019s a county park with some nice wooded trails and a nifty frisbee golf course out through the deep woods. If you like to enjoy a 30 minute hike through the woods you\u2019ll enjoy this park.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSgPRbFTOjORjVkDJG9nWRuUzf27OCH9HDUuykdYibT-9O4_LYKcJh8aXNxe6ymQ7KRy9gzXFj_9ic4\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our first stop on our 2013 adventure is a short drive up I45 from south of Houston to Lake Conroe Thousand Trails near Willis, TX.
