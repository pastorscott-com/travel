Since I have done a couple of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2019\/07\/10\/2019-gettysburg-farm-thousand-trails-dover-pa\/\">recent reviews<\/a> of this nice campground there&#8217;s no need for me to do another at this time.<\/p>\n<p>The main reason we returned here was that we needed a base of operations to attend a wedding 100 miles from here. I was graciously given permission to leave the camper unoccupied for a couple of days (something not normally allowed for traveling members of Thousand Trails).<\/p>\n<p>This stay is, though, part of a bit of an experiment for us this summer. During our previous years a stay of longer than 11 days was unusual for us. We &#8220;land&#8221; for the winters and travel throughout the summer. This year we returned to south-central Pennsylvania, bouncing between the various Thousand Trails for just over six weeks. Considering that we enjoyed a couple of visits from family and then attended a wedding it worked out. However, one outcome of our experiment is that we think we&#8217;d rather, in general, keep to less-than-two-week stays. There&#8217;s no right or wrong in any of this. We&#8217;ve known some folks who move nightly or close to it. For me that would be like having a job. Touring fulltimers have to find the approach that suits them best. For us, 10-11 days gives us the right mix of sightseeing and &#8220;just-living&#8221; days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are just finishing up our second stay in as many months at Gettysburg Farm Thousand Trails near Dover, PA.
