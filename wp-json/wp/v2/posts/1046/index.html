There are actually two sections to the park and we visited via the eastern entrance.\u00a0 The western entrance is quite a bit farther from us and the two sections of Pinnacles aren\u2019t connected by road.\u00a0 After seeing the visitor center we drove on to where the road ends and began a 20 minute hike to Bear Gulch Cave from there. This is a talus cave which means it was created by boulders and rocks falling and choking the narrow canyons creating ceilings, passages, and rooms (<a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150120002614\/http:\/\/www.sfnps.org\/talus_caves\">http:\/\/www.sfnps.org\/talus_caves<\/a>). The trail to the cave is fairly easy in spite of there being a few narrow passages and moderate inclines. We were only able to go into the lower half of the cave. \u00a0The cave is home to Townsends Big-Eared Bats, a protected species in the State of California.\u00a0 This time of the year there are still bats in the upper portion of the cave so the public is kept out of that area.\u00a0 We did see two bats on the ceiling in the public area of the cave.\u00a0 There are many hiking opportunities in this national park, several appear to be rather challenging.\u00a0 The short hike we took, though, is only considered to be \u201cmoderate\u201d and, really, most any reasonably able person should be able to do it.<\/p>\n<p>Our other sightseeing adventure was a day trip to the Monterey Peninsula.\u00a0 The area is only 25 miles or so directly west of our campground.\u00a0 However, because of the mountains it is actually a 60 mile drive on some rather busy highways.\u00a0 We started our tour at the Museum of Monterey. The admission is free for the month of September. The first floor is filled with works by local artists. I especially liked the stained glass pieces of art. The second floor has historic memorabilia from the early Native Americans and other early settlers and immigrants. The Maritime historic memorabilia is quite impressive. There\u2019s a captain\u2019s quarters, items used on the sailing ships, and a variety of scrimshaw that is interesting.\u00a0 Nearby is Old Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with several restaurants, whale tours, and shops. Of most interest to us were the many sea lions that are resting on the supports of the wharf and also swimming below us.<\/p>\n<p>After having lunch we took a leisurely drive along Ocean View Blvd. stopping at several public access places along the way to watch the ships, wildlife, and the waves. The views are amazing and there are many places to stop and soak it all in.\u00a0 We saw more sea lions, a few dolphin, and a wide variety of birds.\u00a0 At Asilomar State Beach we took a stroll down to look at the tide pools.<\/p>\n<p>This was our last visit to the Pacific Ocean on this trip before turning east and beginning our slow journey back to Texas.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ8qMfaaeShtBz0xqb8HssNiEs3ixPolKFqisHiaGroeuLyrmFgpWDB1psoKjQdagYZ1E3ucrAQA-i1\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Our visit to the newest U.S. National Park, Pinnacles NP, was a fun adventure.\u00a0 The park is located about 20 miles south of our campground and around 40 miles south of Hollister, CA.
