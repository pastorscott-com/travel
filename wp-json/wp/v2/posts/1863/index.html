While there are sites on the north side of the one campground road, the sites on the river side are by far the most popular. The Ohio River is right outside your rear window (or if you pull a motor home in nose first, it\u2019s right outside your front window). A short distance from the campground is a very nice city river-front walking area. Historic downtown Madison is also a short distance away with interesting shops and nicely preserved architecture, hearkening back to the day when riverboats plied the waters. Again, it\u2019s all about the river.<\/p>\n<p>The campsites, themselves, aren\u2019t anything to brag about. They are way too close together putting your neighbors on either side just a few steps away. If there\u2019s any redeeming point about the spacing it\u2019s that each site is at a pretty hard angle making your \u201cfront\u201d yard also your neighbor\u2019s \u201cback\u201d yard. If everyone just uses their front yard there\u2019s enough room for you to use the picnic table and set out some lawn chairs to watch the river. However, if your neighbor in a motorhome happens to want to pull in nose first that scheme is messed up and you end up with the front door of their RV matching up with the front door of yours \u2013 creating a shared front yard. On the other hand, the utility hookups actually support this approach because the water\/electric hookups are on every other site. If you get an even numbered site they are on the normal, driver\u2019s side of the rig (when backing in). Otherwise, you either pull in nose first or you have to pass the hose\/electric under the camper.<\/p>\n<p>There are no sewer hookups in the campground, but there is a dump station. The campground has for-pay WiFi. We didn\u2019t use it as our Verizon signal was a strong 4G. Also satellite TV was easy to get \u2013 after all you are basically aiming it out over the river and there are no trees in play. The bathrooms are old and worn but reasonably clean and in working condition. Because of the public nature of the campground (right along a city street) you pay a $5 deposit to get a bathroom key.<\/p>\n<p>The number of sites is limited so if you are coming during the busy time of the year I strongly suggest you call ahead for reservations \u2013 especially if you want a riverside spot.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ06iOMfJszuXsKoimUnh9BmjSUxx9Vsd17y3oJf_0mYtHvGJQZnWjsfv6jfpWCLll10xV0l45L2Fif\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The City Campground in Madison, IN is all about the river view.
