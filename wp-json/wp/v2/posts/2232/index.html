It\u2019s a 15 minute or so drive south of the interstate at Ocean Springs, MS.  The sites in the campground are water\/electric only with good roads and paved sites.  We received a friendly welcome and, when we needed to change sites, the ranger helped us out, putting us in a more suitable site.  You may want to know, though, or reason for moving: several of the sites on the parameter (but not all) on the main loop have a considerable slope front to rear.  It was highly unlikely that we would have gotten the 5th wheel level in our original site, even with the landing gear as short as possible.  I doubt that even a small motorhome in that site would have any chance of getting level front to back.  Of course, small campers (popups, Casitas, etc.) would have done fine there.  We were allowed to move to one of the two \u201cemergency sites\u201d that are kept vacant for use when necessary.  The campground, itself, is clean and pretty and the park beyond the campground boasts a beautiful Welcome Center and lots of nicely developed hiking trails.  We had some issues with biting gnats (no-see-ums) which are a bit of a nuisance.  The price for this campground is excellent, especially with our senior America the Beautiful Pass: we paid just $11 a night.  All in all, we think this is a good stop along I10 especially if you are good with water\/electric only and can avoid the problem sites.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR3OWSF8Sr9ennWhNQjO19Df7OTezB7ddLFdtj5xJVCIRDeeoW4977ebJv4mIo3tqlZIMlrthKxxfti\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re looking for a stop along the short Mississippi portion of I10 you might want to check out Davis Bayou Campground in the Gulf Islands National Seashore.
