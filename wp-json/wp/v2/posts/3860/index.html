I think we appreciated the campground more this time than we did before. That&#8217;s mainly because we are more seasoned Thousand Trails users and better know what to expect at these properties.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/09\/14\/campground-review-forest-lake-thousand-trails-advance-nc\/\">a previous review of this campground<\/a> \u2013 honestly, there are few, if any difference for better or worse. The pictures I took then are still representative of the campground. With that in mind I&#8217;m only adding a few with this review.<\/p>\n<p>Forest Lake has a wide variety of campsites. Some will only accommodate a smaller rig while others are big enough for even the largest ones. Recently, the campground has started making an effort to assign sites based on the size of the rig. This is counter to long standing Thousand Trails policy, but in a campground with such a variety of campsites it makes a lot of sense. In the past a person with a smaller camper could pick one of the most spacious sites. When the bigger rig arrived there was simply no place they could fit.<\/p>\n<p>Now, having said that, let me add that if Thousand Trails would stop selling so many annual sites much of this problem would go away. Still, I noticed that there were vacant sites throughout our stay, although many spots that might be considered prime are permanently taken.<\/p>\n<p>Although the temperatures were over 90 at times, the pools (there are two big ones) won&#8217;t be open for a few more days yet, over the Memorial Day weekend. Also, for some reason, the community buildings were left locked up until later in the morning \u2013 I&#8217;m not sure why.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, we like this campground and will be happy to return when we travel this area again.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSTBHmEu6ceMdDug38An36kqWAX7t7VDU51NeBnOr03TypWlyIcpHp1LlYxNHVcrf0nd8FkTqiyWW_m\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It has been a few years since we visited Forest Lake Thousand Trails, near Lexington, NC.
