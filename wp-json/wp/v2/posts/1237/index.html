morning and I was surprised at how distant land was on either side of the ship.\u00a0 It was raining and the wind was blowing, creating whitecaps on the water around us.\u00a0 Jackie and I went forward for breakfast.\u00a0 I usually have a very good sense of direction and I felt the ship was going west rather than northeast as it should be in making its way to Skagway.\u00a0 Of course, cruising, of all activities, seems especially designed to confuse one&#8217;s sense of direction.\u00a0 After all, one day, when walking some interior hallway forward one is walking, say, east.\u00a0 Then, you go to bed, wake up the next morning and walk in the same direction, but you are now going south.\u00a0 Again, it&#8217;s easy to get turned around.<\/p>\n<p>Still, as we ate breakfast, I remarked that I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we were diverting from Skagway.\u00a0 The widening waterway and the \u201cfeeling\u201d that we were going in the wrong direction was soon confirmed as it was announced that when Rhapsody arrived at Skagway at 4:00 a.m. that the whole area had rain and 50 mph winds.\u00a0 The captain had gotten permission to divert us to a day of cruising Endicott Arm down to Dawes Glacier and then going to a yet to be announced port the next day.<\/p>\n<p>I was pretty disappointed that we weren&#8217;t going to Skagway because we had a car rented and planned a drive up the Klondike Highway into the Yukon for the day.\u00a0 However, doing that in weather conditions such as those wouldn&#8217;t be much fun anyway so we decided to go with the flow and look forward to our unexpected visit to Endicott Arm.\u00a0 This also meant we wouldn&#8217;t visit Tracy Arm as was scheduled.\u00a0 The cruise people spun it as something special because the big cruise ships generally don&#8217;t get permission to go up Endicott and this would be only the second time for Rhapsody to visit it.\u00a0 Since I&#8217;ll probably never see Tracy Arm I can&#8217;t compare the two, but, honestly, I can&#8217;t imagine it being more beautiful than Endicott Arm turned out to be.<\/p>\n<p>The ship cruised through a fairly narrow passage with sheer cliffs on each side.\u00a0 Waterfalls were abundant; some dropping over 1000 feet and many were quite large.\u00a0 At times, the mountains on either side were higher than could be seen looking out the windows.\u00a0 We saw, literally, hundreds of waterfalls.\u00a0 Ultimately, we arrived at the glacier.\u00a0 It was taller than Mendenhall, which we saw the day before.\u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t believe how close the ship came to the face of Dawes Glacier.\u00a0 In anticipation of the scenery, Jackie and I had staked out a couple of window seats on deck 11 and it turned out to be the perfect place.\u00a0 We took over 200 photos, although I managed to cull the number down quite a bit.\u00a0 The trip back out enabled us to see the opposite side of the Arm and weather conditions had improved a bit so the photos we took on the way out were somewhat brighter than those we took going in.<\/p>\n<p>Back out in the Inside Passage we saw several dolphin and a few whales.\u00a0 We decided to skip the main dining hall again and eat at the Windjammer buffet.\u00a0 By being there when they opened the doors we were able to get a window table right at the front of the ship.\u00a0 The view from there was neat and we even saw a couple of whales as we ate a leisurely supper.\u00a0 All in all, in spite of the change of itinerary and the inclement weather, we thoroughly enjoyed the day.\u00a0 Because of the diversion, we were told we were headed to Ketchikan on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>I was rather disappointed when the ship began to rock and roll mid evening.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure, but I think we went back out into the open sea for the overnight journey.\u00a0 Maybe it has something to do with opening the Casino.\u00a0 Also, there was some kind of poker tournament going on during the cruise.\u00a0 Since the pre-cruise information said we were supposed to cruise the Inside Passage on our journey south and I couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed that we were, once again, moving out of sight of land.\u00a0 About 9:30 I went to bed to escape some of the discomfort of walking around in the up and down, back and forth motion of the ship.\u00a0 Jackie and I had no problem with sea sickness, but after a while I started feeling somewhat dizzy.\u00a0 Just in case I took some motion sickness pills and then, in the night, I ate a few Rolaids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 5: Ketchikan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Alas, this day&#8217;s blog has been lost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 6: At Sea<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our Wednesday was spent at sea and the rocking and rolling continued.\u00a0 However it was only mildly objectionable.\u00a0 Again, my objection was that the itinerary showed us being in the inside passage for this part of the cruise.\u00a0 When I booked the cruise one of the negatives for this particular cruise was that it went out to sea as it traveled north in the first days of the trip.\u00a0 I decided I&#8217;d risk the possible sea sickness to get north as quickly as possible and then enjoy the inside passage the rest of the trip.\u00a0 Instead, in addition to the journey north, it seemed we were out of sight of land at every opportunity.\u00a0 Thankfully, Jackie and I weren&#8217;t suffering from sea sickness.\u00a0 Still, though, the constant motion was somewhat disorienting and, instead of watching the beautiful green mountains and occasional wildlife, we had the rolling sea with whitecaps in all directions.<\/p>\n<p>This was an interesting stage of the cruise, as people had pretty much figured out what is what on the ship.\u00a0 Rather than exploring the ship, one could pick an area and go straight to it.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, I settled on the 11th deck with its large, ceiling to floor slanted windows as my favorite hangout.\u00a0 Sitting here I could see a great distance.\u00a0\u00a0 The ocean view highlight of the day for me was seeing two dolphin crest in perfect unity right next to the ship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Day 4: Not Skagway but Endicott Arm We woke early Monday morning and I was surprised at how distant land was on either side
