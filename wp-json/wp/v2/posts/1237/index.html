however, subsequent meals were just fine.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/-wg3WR9dokLU\/SosSuki_LMI\/AAAAAAAAG_8\/qXd99XDkolc\/s144-c-o\/aboard%252520rhapsody%252520-%252520seattle%252520-%252520%2525208-14-2009%2525205-46-17%252520PM.JPG\"\/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Luggage and cruise documents in hand we arrived at Seattle&#8217;s Pier 91.\u00a0 Friends from the Seattle area hosted us for a few days and then were kind enough to drop us off at the pier.\u00a0 As soon as the vehicle stopped a porter asked us if we were on Rhapsody of the Seas.\u00a0 When we [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[6,37,116,122],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1237"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1237"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1237\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1237"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1237"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1237"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
