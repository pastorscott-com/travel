Per my own instructions we walked along an avenue, turned at the right place, and there sat two busses with the correct route number on them. When we approached the front bus, the driver pointed across the street to yet another bus, just loading. My self-made instructions were almost perfect, just not pointing to the correct side of the street.<\/p>\n<p>We did stuff like that as we found our way around London and Paris, not quite moving around as locals, but independently flowing from one place to another in a satisfying way.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/100_2132.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/100_2132-300x169.jpg\" width=\"320\" height=\"180\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>On both the Tube and Metro (subway and bus alike) you need to know the train or bus\u2019 ultimate destination plus your stop along the way. Having a pre-printed page of instructions (to and from) makes a huge difference as you stand in an underground station deciding which platform is the right one. Of course, you have big maps in every station and, of course, you have a pocket map \u2013 but things feel rather confusing when there are thousands of rushing commuters all around you.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no chance people will think you\u2019re a local, but having the piece of paper in your hand that says, in your own words: \u201cAt Green Park station, take the Jubilee Line towards Stratford Underground Station or West Ham \u2013 get off at Canary Wharf\u201d gives you more confidence than just knowing you need to \u201ctake the tube to Canary Wharf.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More \u201cafter the trip\u201d thoughts\u2026 If you\u2019re going to London or Paris and like to explore on your own, I suggest you make a list of places you want to visit, centering each day around one major event but throwing in some more or less \u201cday\u2019s off\u201d along the way.
