From the campground to our parking lot was less than 15 minutes! Because we were in the city for the convention all we wanted from the campground was a good place to park the RV and Lake Haven Retreat fit the bill nicely.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s urban camping, although the small lake does add at least a bit of a camping feeling to the place.  Most of the campsites are pull through \u201cback to back\u201d sites.  Our neighbor on the driver\u2019s side, then, was very close.  On the other side there\u2019s a strip of grass that is shared with the folks on that side.  Again, we were in town for the convention, so having a level site with good utilities (including WiFi) worked for us.<\/p>\n<p>Arriving at the campground might be a bit confusing.  Arriving on Hwy 37 one turns onto Edgewood.  The very first driveway is for the campground even though it looks as if it\u2019s just a house.  That house is the office.  Beside the office is the laundry and showers.  This makes them pretty much equally unhandy for most everyone.  Just past the driveway for the campground is a fire station.  We could hear the trucks going out once in a while, but I think they must delay the sirens till they are down the street a ways because they weren\u2019t ever a big issue for us.<\/p>\n<p>The campground has several long term residents, evident by the big propane bottles.  However, everything is kept reasonably neat and orderly.  We paid a bit more than we usually pay, but again, this campground is all about location.  <\/p>\n<p>If you need a spot in Indy, especially on the south side or near downtown, this campground is likely your best bet.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRZurZHysXNKOMg2BJo8SGo2vaUADYS_N___gEyFn2f49ETljzmB2Ztk523IoOrop_aWeamcmOvPOik\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lake Haven Retreat in Indianapolis, Indiana was a good place for us to stay while attending Nazarene General Assembly at the Indiana Convention Center in downtown.
