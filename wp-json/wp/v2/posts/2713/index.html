One key is getting it perfectly level, something that is easy enough to do using a simple bubble level and the individually adjustable legs. The other key is getting it tall enough to &#8220;look over&#8221; any trees, etc. that are in the line of sight to the satellites. In some locations the sky is clear and I just leave it low to the ground. In a few places, though, I need all the height I could get.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, the whole setup is less than 15 minutes. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2019\/08\/29\/using-a-home-style-dish\/\">I describe the process here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can anchor the tripod using a screw in doggie stake or, if the ground is rocky I just use a five gallon bucket of water. I think this is the Cadillac of portable dish tripods, and in spite of the cost, it&#8217;s a good investment for those of us who need to set up a home-style dish on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-HETS0t0syUo\/WprjybtOmkI\/AAAAAAAAwd4\/15ZwzCCiMm8reITTAi-WVIAPRXGK7UJPQCCoYBhgL\/s0\/IMG_20180303_111115.jpg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1920\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve written about my satellite TV setup before, mostly in reference to the Winegard Carryout I used for a few years.
