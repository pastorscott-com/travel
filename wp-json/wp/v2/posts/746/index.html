For us, it&#8217;s a great stop because our journey will take us north on 550 once we leave.<\/p>\n<p>We really like this campground. The sites are long, there are shelters on each campsite, and even AstroTurf carpeting. Hookups are water and electric with both 30 and 50 amp sites available. The water hookups, for some reason, are on the wrong side of the camper, so you&#8217;ll need a longer water hose for water.<\/p>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t find the lack of sewer hookups to be a big of a deal because we were allowed to water the trees and plants around our campsite with our gray water.<\/p>\n<p>This campground serves as a good center of operations for exploring Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It is probably a bit far off of I40 for those traveling that route (It&#8217;s about 17 miles from I40 to the campground).<\/p>\n<p>For history buffs, the campground is adjacent to the Coronado Historic Site. Also, there are many restaurants and other businesses within minutes of the campground. Our Verizon 4G signal is quite good.<\/p>\n<p>Due to high winds we extended our stay by an extra day.\u00a0 The campground was a great place to be while we waited for better weather.\u00a0 We give this place a thumbs up and will likely return.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQKTv5R7HTKCNTlP-xLWvsYm-L9cTuQykbQGduqU6D-I6CaoBMMMNx-L8WMiXXN-RyEy8ftdjOpu0FH\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fifteen miles north of Albuquerque, NM and just off of I25 on highway 550 is Coronado Campground, which is operated by the city of Bernalillo.
