The campground has many great, wooded, paved sites with nice separation. This corps facility is on Mark Twain Lake, but none of the sites are actually on the lake. A few overlook the water down below but most are in the woods. The roads are excellent and the individual sites are a mixture of electric only and full hookups. I think all the sites offer up to 50 amp service. The sites are long and pretty level side to side but most have a slope front to back. To get level our 5th wheel was &#8220;kneeling down&#8221; significantly. In the Eastern Campground my Verizon 4G signal was very good.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft \" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-9ryeNlAxMv0\/Wwb1_QRNITI\/AAAAAAAAx6E\/umx04UwTD30RHeVG2ksnP9eKJkWtnPFPgCKgBGAs\/s1600\/IMG_20180518_094359.jpg\" width=\"230\" height=\"129\" \/>There are a few things you might want to know. First this campground is out in the boonies. Once you leave Morgan City you are still about 15 miles out into the country to the campground, much of that on smooth, but speed limited roads. It is around 45 minutes to the closest Walmart in Hannibal. Second, we battled both ticks and swarming gnats. Third, if you want satellite, pick your campsite carefully. Generally, you want one on the north side of a road. Those on the west side of a road would be especially blocked from having an eye to the sky.<br \/>\nWe almost always like the CoE campgrounds and this one is no exception. We give Indian Creek two thumbs up.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"504\" height=\"284\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cKiqfPhByzA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/QygPd4Jrdrqew4re2\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We really liked Indian Creek CoE Campground, located near Morgan City, MO (about 35 miles west of Hannibal).
