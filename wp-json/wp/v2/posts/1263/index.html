So much for a repeat of Rita in which the day before landfall it took a big jump to the north.  It may still move some, but I see that all the forecast models are settling on our area.  Frankly, with hurricane force winds extending over 100 miles out from the center, like horseshoes, just being close counts!<\/p>\n<p>The possible good news is that the storm has not made it up to a three as was expected through much of yesterday.  We&#8217;re still looking at some big wind, but not as high as it could have been.<\/p>\n<p>As was predicted, no rain yet.  That&#8217;s good, as I have been working outside finishing up on storm preparations.  I still have a bit to do, but I needed to cool down a few minutes, so I am doing this blog entry.<\/p>\n<p>Our block looks to be about half empty with everyone else staying put.  Most houses are boarded up, but several are not.  Time will tell if it was necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Be aware that we are not under an evacuation order here.  The evacuations are all related to a possible storm surge that will inundate low lying coastal areas.  Our area is just far enough inland and just high enough that we are in no danger of being swept away by a storm surge.  If we lived 10 miles closer to the coast it would be a different story.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/casita.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/casita-300x225.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>As for us, the patio is empty and all loose stuff is stored in the metal shed or in the garage.  Our little Casita camper is full of water with the battery charged and plenty of propane just in case we need to live in it for a few days.  I normally only put rear jacks down on it when camping, but I have just added front jacks too.  The idea is to stabilize the little camper as much as possible.  The Casitas have the nickname of &#8220;eggs&#8221; because of their fiberglass shape.  It is quite light (not a good thing right now) but it is also streamlined (that&#8217;s a very good thing in high winds).  If we are without electricity for a few days we can use the camper&#8217;s refrigerator and stove &#8212; that is, provided we still have a camper tomorrow afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Well there&#8217;s more to do and time is short, back to hurricane prep.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/photos\/101128941131953400860\/albums\/5246367878190115185\">Lots of photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This morning we find that the track of the storm is pretty much the same as it was when we went to bed last night.
