We drove through treeless mountains into pine covered mountains and soon found ourselves in the fertile Yakima valley with it\u2019s vineyards and apple orchards.  Along the way we drove up and over \u201cDead Man\u2019s Pass\u201d and then, after leaving the city of Yakima we drove up and over Manastash Ridge.  Dead Man\u2019s pass is rated as one of the toughest trucker drives in America with mile after mile of 6% downhill grades.  Then, as we left Yakima we began a long steep climb followed by a steep descent, then \u201crepeat\u201d and then \u201crepeat again.\u201d  The truck handled it fine, although we heard the whirlybird sound of the high speed cooling fan kick in on the uphills and worked the tow-haul mode on the transmission pretty hard coming down the steep grades.<\/p>\n<p>We were happy to arrive at Yakima River RV park in Ellensburg, WA \u2013 exiting I82 right at the base of the final of the three big down hill\u2019s between Yakima and Ellensburg.<\/p>\n<p>This campground has a country feel with horses and cattle at pasture just the other side of the fence.  If the campground was full you\u2019d have some close neighbors, as the sites are set up so one camper is facing one direction and the next the other.  You could potentially have \u201cdoor to door\u201d neighbors!<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no bathhouse or facilities of any kind but most of the sites are full hookups.  The campground provides good WiFi and our cell signal is quite good too.  We met the owner, a nice lady who had lots of advice about the area.  Alas, this is the last of what will be three one-nighters in a row for us.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow we head west on I90, up and over yet another mountain, and then skirt Seattle and head north just a short distance.  We\u2019ll be back in the Thousand Trails system and our short stays and longer drives will come to an end for several months to come.  Our deluge of blog entries should slow down a bit as our pace slows.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff The drive north on I84 and I82 from west-central Oregon to south-central Washington was our most challenging and interesting yet.
