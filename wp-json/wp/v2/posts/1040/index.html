The weather was considerably cooler there with wind and a foggy mist coming in.  The bridge is an amazing structure and you can read about the history and construction in park right beside it.   I was very pleased to know that the Golden Gate Park is under the care of National Park Service with rangers ready to help you with information about the park.  From there we began our trip clear across town back to the Caltrain station, taking the bus and then a streetcar\/subway.  It was supper time and we stopped to eat.  Once we got back to the train station we saw that there is a Panera Bread restaurant right beside the Caltrain and wished we had waited and gotten sandwiches to eat on the train.  The train we caught was an evening train which was about full but emptied out as we continued the hour and a half to San Jose.  <\/p>\n<p>All in all it was a very enjoyable and tiring day.  Some may prefer doing the more costly on\/off bus tours around the city, especially for a one day visit.  Really, with so much to see, a person could spend several days in San Francisco and not see it all.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQV3l10tOQs3ZfAUiVYE8OeVo8-mgM4a1kUHlBqTbKXmGFRZ4YAzdtusoQo9HD_XK9o2IdYrDg4OGMy\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We then took a couple of buses to get to the Golden Gate Bridge.
