Since <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/07\/29\/campground-review-cowanesque-lake-tompkins-campground-acoe-lawrenceville-pa\/\">I reviewed the campground then<\/a>, I&#8217;ll just do a brief review and post a few new photos.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t especially by design, but we ended up in the same campsite as we were in when we were here six years ago. It is, though, a great campsite. No doubt, the spots along the lake are great sites, if you can&#8217;t get one of them, Knoll 17 is a good one. For one thing, it is one of the few sites that offers a clear shot at the Dish network eastern arc satellites. I&#8217;m guessing that the spots along the lake have a view of the sky, but aside from that, there aren&#8217;t many sites that do.<\/p>\n<p>About half the sites are full hookup \u2013 the rest are water\/electric only.<br \/>\nThe campground is in a bit of a black hole for cell service. We had a 1X signal. That meant that a text message might get through and that&#8217;s about it. We found that if we walked along the lake to a spot closest to the dam that we got a usable 3G signal. Needless to say, if internet is important to you it might be better to find a different campground.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you are looking for great Corps campground in a beautiful setting you&#8217;ll love this campground.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ9b2OZFfAXco-biom-dYi-x547PeMhedJiVs-ahEbmfb0KKEk31DPTLPVy0oBwesXfPwRx-DYS6Ao6\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were at Tompkins CoE Campground at Lawrenceburg, PA in 2013 and were glad for an opportunity to visit this beautiful campground again.
