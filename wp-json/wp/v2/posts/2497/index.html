While this is no tranquil, picturesque campground it is a clean, efficient, well-planned urban RV Park. The roads are good and the campsites, while not spacious, are big enough. Most sites are pull through spots that, again, are just long enough. There\u2019s nice grass between sites and excellent utility hookups. The park has a new office and meeting space. The restrooms are as nice as you\u2019ll find. We didn\u2019t hook up to the cable TV but the WiFi performed well except for an overnight issue that was resolved the next morning. The campground even has new underground tornado shelters.<\/p>\n<p>The campground has recently expanded and with that expansion a new entrance was added. Access is now right off of the I35 north feeder road. Just watch for the big campground sign. This is, of course, Oklahoma City so there is both traffic and the noise it brings. There is also the convenience of being close to most everything. The price reflects the location, but, really we\u2019ve paid more. If you need a spot in OKC, this is it.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQnONMtZj4sZABJtSkz0_YLc5nolB49avDEXDcd6atxAV7Xr5tOXQ9veR5X66pg87EQUUpHwEdIoQKm\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/D8XrWfsgp8RVRSPZA\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Roadrunner RV Park in Oklahoma City, OK gets good reviews and we agree.
