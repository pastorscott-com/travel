As is often the case, how a person feels about this campground depends on what campsite they get. There are many water\/electric sites nestled in the woods. They feel like a lot of the campgrounds in this part of the world. However, there are some sites that are right along Skagit Bay. These are, of course, the most popular. In fact, during busy times there\u2019s a waiting list for them and at 10:00 each morning some happy campers can check in at the ranger station and be told that they can move to one of these sites. The very best, in my opinion, are near the Activity Center. They don\u2019t have sewer hookups, but they make up for it with great views. I noticed that several motorhomes pull into these sites head first to take full advantage of the views. There are several sites with full hookups. Most are woodsy sites but a few have nice views of the bay. We spent the last week of our time here in one of those sites and enjoyed it very much. Supposedly, we could get a satellite TV signal there as well, but I had no luck on that front.<\/p>\n<p>La Conner Thousand Trails is all about the water. The view from the Activity Center is available to all and is simply wonderful. One evening Jackie and I especially enjoyed watching some sea otters. Also, we had a good time looking at an eagle perched high in a tree overlooking the water, master of his domain.<\/p>\n<p>My Verizon phone was iffy at best with 1 or 2 bars of signal strength. Using a signal booster I could get a reliable cell signal and even manage a slow, but usable, data connect at least part of the time. Another reason to hang out at the Activity Center is that it has WiFi. It&#8217;s not great WiFi but with a little patience a person can get their internet fix there.<\/p>\n<p>The sunsets here are breathtaking, but cold as the air starts moving up off of the water. I can see why so many people love La Conner Thousand Trails &#8211; I really like it here myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Our move from Birch Bay to La Conner took about an hour.
