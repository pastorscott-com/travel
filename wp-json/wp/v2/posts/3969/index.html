Obviously, not a lot has changed in just nine months so this will be a brief review with some new photos.<\/p>\n<p>Last fall when were were at Gettysburg Farm the creek-side sites were closed due to flooding. This stay they were open. However, the area got quite a bit of rain right after Independence day and those sites got pretty soggy. I&#8217;ll include a few photos of the wet conditions. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d want to stay in that area which is basically grass camping with water\/electric hookups.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the campground had some standing water, but nothing that would cause anyone any problems.<\/p>\n<p>We appreciated the helpful staff who went out of the way to make us feel welcome. Also, the pool was open and much enjoyed by many, especially during the flip-side of the rainy days when it was very hot and muggy.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I noticed, especially on the hotter days is that one row of campsites is right across the road from some of the animal pens, including the pigs and goats. It may be that you really want the farm experience, but if not, you might want to pick a spot a ways away from those pens.<\/p>\n<p>When you reserve a campsite at Gettysburg Farm you now pick whether you want a w\/e\/s site or just one with w\/e. Of course, the FHU spots fill up first. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, some folks really enjoy the creek-side spots and, with the free pump out service, it really isn&#8217;t that big of a deal (although, the potential standing water problem would concern most anyone). Anyway, if you want to get a FHU site on a summer weekend you will want to reserve early if possible.<\/p>\n<p>Another change we noticed is that new arrivals aren&#8217;t allowed to check in before noon. One morning I saw four or five rigs lined up waiting to move to a spot even though there were a number of vacant sites. In this case the early bird just gets to wait till noon.<\/p>\n<p>Again, we like this campground and would have no problem returning for another visit.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSPE8o6UXQ1Hif7BO4kzo401dvlgqVxKKaGwL48iFBEklQ5TULsNeaJrHQHBIVxMXJyr5Io57Yvmwer\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were at Gettysburg Farm Thousand Trail near Dover, PA less than a year ago and I wrote this review then.
