amazing train routes up into the Alps.\u00a0 Our trip from Lucerne to Brig, Switzerland included time in a famous tunnel that has a double spiral (like a figure-eight.)\u00a0 The funny thing is, aside from being in the dark for more than 20 miles, there was no sensation of going round and round.\u00a0 The spirals allow the train to gain altitude in a short distance and as far as I could tell the train never slowed down through the entire trip.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived in Brig and, after finding our hotel, we looked around the pretty city, surrounded by snow caped mountains.\u00a0 The weather has been unseasonably warm here (mostly in the 40s).\u00a0 Because of that the snow level is confined to the mountains around us.\u00a0 We think that is just right!\u00a0 The hotel is adjacent to Stockalper Castle.\u00a0 It is impressive to look at, but doesn&#8217;t offer tours in the winter time.\u00a0 The other thing Brig is famous for is that the train station here serves as a major interchange for some important rail lines.<\/p>\n<p>There are two famous rail excursions in this part of Switzerland.\u00a0 The Glacier Express travels between two major ski areas.\u00a0 However, it travels on the regular tracks and the regular trains that offer service to the same places have nice big windows.\u00a0 I say that to explain that over the next two days we are traveling trains on the Glacier Express route, but not on that particular excursion.\u00a0 The nice thing for us is that we can hop on and off the trains wherever we like rather than needing to stay with a tour.<\/p>\n<p>This morning we left Brig and headed up deeper into the mountains to a world class winter playground: Zermatt, Switzerland.\u00a0 The train climbed up above the snow line.\u00a0 The scenery is amazing.\u00a0 For many people Zermatt is all about skiing.\u00a0 There are thousands of hotel rooms and chalet rentals.\u00a0 Only electric powered, small taxis and a couple of small, free, electric busses are allowed on the streets.\u00a0 There are several ski lifts and a cog railway offering access on up to the ski areas high above the town.<\/p>\n<p>And, from most anywhere the Matterhorn, which towers over 14,000 feet can be seen. \u00a0It is beautiful beyond words.\u00a0 We looked around, took photos, checked out an area where buildings dating back over 400 years have been preserved.\u00a0 After having lunch we returned to Brig.\u00a0 Due to the time difference, we got back to our room just in time to catch Sunday School and church in Texas!<\/p>\n<p>Here are a couple of travel tips that might be helpful to some.\u00a0 First, there&#8217;s a free app called &#8220;Google Lens.&#8221;\u00a0 It has other uses, but it&#8217;s translate function is great for people traveling.\u00a0 Using Lens you turn on translate.\u00a0 Your phone camera comes on and you can aim it at any text.\u00a0 The app translates the text to English and on the screen the words actually morph from whatever language you are looking at into English!\u00a0 Tonight we were buying sandwiches to bring back to our room.\u00a0 The labels were in German, but when I looked at them through Lens I could see that they were turkey.\u00a0 We don&#8217;t speak hardly any German, but we were able to navigate our way through the store and get what we wanted.\u00a0 Really cool!<\/p>\n<p>Another thing: on the train and many other places, announcements in Switzerland are repeated in German, then French, and then English.\u00a0 That makes it easy to get around.\u00a0 Aside from that, since we are in a major tourist area, we hear English spoken most everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow, we continue the Glacier Express route.\u00a0 What a way to start a New Year!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The primary theme of our Italy-Switzerland Adventure is train trips.\u00a0 We rode the train *under* the Alps from Milan to Lucerne, and now,
