Astros, Texans, and Rockets games, the museums, and the medical center are all a 15-30 minute drive. It is close to nearly every restaurant chain you\u2019ve ever heard of and there\u2019s shopping of all kinds within minutes. The resort is right at the intersection of Highway 288 (an expressway) and Beltway 8 (a toll road) providing easy access east\/west and north\/south. The entrance to the resort is actually on the Beltway 8 feeder road. That means if you intend on going any direction aside from east you have to travel down the one way road, cross over to the other side of the toll road and come back to continue in the desired direction.<\/p>\n<p>That, in itself, is no big deal. The noise of the traffic, and the traffic itself, can be a nuisance, but is part of the price one pays for being in such close proximity to the major city that Houston is.<\/p>\n<p>The resort itself, although pricier than we\u2019re used to paying, is well kept in every way. The grass is constantly mowed and edged. The roads are excellent and wide enough for two big rigs to pass. The restrooms and laundries are the nicest we\u2019ve seen in any RV park. There\u2019s an Activity center, multiple laundries and restrooms, two doggie parks, a pool, and a spa \u2013 all well cared for.<\/p>\n<p>The pull through sites are long enough for any rig. The back in sites are limited to rigs 35\u2019 or less. As is true of most any urban RV park, the sites are quite close together. Some of the back in sites are narrower than others. There wasn\u2019t room on our site for both pickup and camper. We could squeeze our small car in next to the camper so we parked the truck in overflow parking.<\/p>\n<p>In any campground the sites nearest the highway are more prone to be noisy and that\u2019s especially true of this campground. Beltway 8 is actually elevated at this point, so the walls do little to block the noise and those sites get the brunt of it all.<\/p>\n<p>Tom Bass Regional Park adjoins the resort and there\u2019s actually a gate one can go through to enter the park. However, the grass on the other side of the gate was generally tall and one had to wade through it quite a ways to get to a better cared for section. Many people, though, took their dogs into that area so they would have more room to roam.<\/p>\n<p> Our stay at Advanced was our longest stay since retiring as we accepted an interim position, filling in between pastors at our home church. I doubt it will come as a surprise to anyone if I mention that it was very hot and humid through the summer!<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for a nice place and close to the Houston action this is a good one.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRgYMZaSElwLDC5N-JRlzaAwOtZUi6Uuorb3sbKE5l6eOZ4KPM627d0FQjVVGk_fktifqBtcBZHRJym\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Advanced RV Resort\u2019s location in Pearland, TX makes it ideal for people who want to be close to downtown Houston.
