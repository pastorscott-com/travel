The campus is beautiful and covers many acres. As we walked we noticed how clean cut the students were.\u00a0 Several smiled and spoke as we passed. \u00a0The Lynchburg transit runs through campus and provides the students easy access to the various areas of the large campus.\u00a0 The campus is about to get a beautiful new library so, while the old library continues to function I decided to pass on doing a blog about it. Two things that got our attention were the giant &#8220;LU&#8221; logo which takes up much of the side of the mountain above the campus and the Liberty Mountain Snowflex Center next to it.\u00a0 The Snowflex is a snowless ski slope where students can go for the view, to ski, snowboard, or tube year around.\u00a0 I think Liberty University is worth a visit if you happen to be in the area.<\/p>\n<p>On Friday we decided to go to Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Popular Forest. He started building this place in 1806 as a retreat from his very pubic life. \u00a0It was privately owned by people outside the Jefferson family from early 1800s until it was acquired by a non-profit group in the early 1980s. The grounds are quiet and restful and tour was very informative.\u00a0 We gained a different perspective on Thomas Jefferson and his life.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to see in this area that we hope to visit on a future trip to this area.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos I have heard so much about Liberty University I wanted to see it for myself. \u00a0The young man in the Visitors center was very friendly and helpful. \u00a0We walked to the DeMoss building that houses the current library in the bottom floor.
