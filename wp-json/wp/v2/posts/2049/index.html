Many people who visit here make sightseeing trips into Houston and even go as far as Galveston.  However, since we lived in the area so many years and actually volunteer at one of the primary Houston attractions, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/san-jacinto-monument\/\">San Jacinto Monument<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/battleship-texas\/\">Battleship Texas<\/a>, we aren\u2019t interested in fighting the Houston traffic to go sightseeing there during our Conroe stays.  <\/p>\n<p>The fun fact is that there are some really great places to visit within an hour or so of Lake Conroe.  During our stay this time we revisited a couple of interesting areas just to the west of Lake Conroe.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-wFXlldi08Xg\/Vx6T_R4RLnI\/AAAAAAAAn9E\/uebdK9P8JqoBkNVi3AqgPaj79QPmyrYxQCHM\/s144-o\/20160425_145606.jpg\"\/> Last but not least, the park is the home of the Barrington Living History Farm.  The home of Anson Jones, the last President of the Republic of Texas, is here. It\u2019s a working farm with costumed staff and period livestock. We saw Texas Longhorn cattle, Ossabaw Island hogs, and chickens.  Scott was happy to spot a small \u201chistorical\u201d snake making itself at home in one of the restored slave quarters.  Our hostess was a friendly lady dressed in period clothing.  She gave us a lot of interesting information on the farmhouse and its history.<\/p>\n<p>We had a great time visiting these \u201cno-Houston-traffic\u201d attractions and recommend them to young and old alike. <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vT6M3nxHVFp0uOuR6sFvRwOL1_vr4ZLpeNSKm7HvcseReZHMQJsipx80VnVepTBbV9mRnuW_n-0_jZe\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve enjoyed several visits to Lake Conroe Thousand Trails near Conroe, TX and our big travel adventures have all started and ended with stays at this nice campground.
