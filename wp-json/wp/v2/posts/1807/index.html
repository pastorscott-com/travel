The roads and the spacious, level campsites are paved.  There are both back in and pull-through sites.  The trees in the campground are smaller, so they don\u2019t offer much shade but, as a result of their size, getting satellite TV is no problem.  Some sites offer 50 amp electric but the majority are 30 amp.  All sites are water\/electric and there is a dump station in the campground.  The restroom\/shower building is modern and clean.  During our stay the price was $25 a night with an over-60 senior discount price of $20.  There are some terrific, paved walking trails and a swimming beach in the park.  The only negative I saw about the campground is that it\u2019s all first-come\/first-served with no reservations possible.  For RVers out on the road this arraignment doesn\u2019t work very well.  We arrived the weekend after Labor Day and had no problem getting a site.   If you plan on coming to this park during busier times, you might want to try arriving on a weeknight; or at least you will want to have a backup campground in mind.  My Verizon 4G signal was a usable 2 bars.  This place is a real winner, especially if you don\u2019t mind taking a chance on getting a site when traveling during busy times of the year.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQbehCbGZioYfs0sMpjptwWKsmlD9TSZCKp32jVwFQpVlBqq8v7UxnU-9g6oRIW0mzu7sBL6IVPNfWK\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ottawa Metro Park Campground is a nice campground located just a few minutes off of I75 in Lima, Ohio, making it a great two night stop for us.
