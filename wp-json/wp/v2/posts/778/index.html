My Verizon phone managed to get a few bars of cell service but data limped along with an occasional 1X connect.  The roads and sites are all good gravel and the pit toilets are clean and have no \u201couthouse\u201d odor.  On our senior pass we stayed for $7.50 a night (others pay $15).   It\u2019s about 30 minutes into Moab, but the entrance to the Island in the Sky portion of Canyonlands is nearby.  <\/p>\n<p>While Jackie and I would prefer full hookups with maybe a pool, we found this dry camping experience to be an occasional acceptable alternative, especially when it is being done for a good reason (like visiting two awesome national parks).  We\u2019re not ready to join the solar-powered boondocking crowd on a regular basis, but staying at Horsethief does allow us to see a bit of what draws them to this style of camping.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ55iHmjlZbsp_-ZhpSoHMitaTiR3a5EpLwHEXnzd7sDK_bf9NMwgBkXlSB21hNrFMJDWnU0VMM8rPf\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Horsethief Campground is a great campground for people who don\u2019t mind being off the grid, who want a very quiet campground, who enjoy beautiful sunsets and star lit nights.
