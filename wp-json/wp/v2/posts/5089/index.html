One not too far from us is the East Lancashire Railway, Bury \u2013 just north of Manchester.  In fact, Bury is at the northern end of the Manchester tram line.  We rode the tram about an hour and a half up to Bury to ride behind the Lady of Legend coal-fired steam locomotive.  The line runs along the River Irwell about 8 miles to the town of Rawtenstall.  The weather started off cool, but nice.  As we rode the train it began to rain followed by small hail!  The weather didn&#8217;t delay our trip any, but it did dampen our desire to do much exploring!  We opted for a coffee shop break followed by a return ride on a vintage diesel train, with a break for lunch and then another ride behind the steam locomotive.<\/p>\n<p>The other half of our adventure was a visit to the Bury Transport Museum.  It was fun checking out a wide variety of antique vehicles there \u2013 ranging from an old tractor to double decker busses to another beautiful steam locomotive. <\/p>\n<p>It was a nice day trip for us, and we recommend it to anyone who likes the old trains.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are several vintage steam railways around the UK.
