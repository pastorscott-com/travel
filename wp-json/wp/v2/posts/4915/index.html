or another called &#8220;Taco Bell.&#8221;\u00a0 Seriously, there were some restaurants that were new to us, but we thought it would be interesting to compare the UK version of &#8220;Five Guys&#8221; with the American one.\u00a0 The result: no difference.\u00a0 Again, had we not paid in pounds we could have been anywhere in the USA.\u00a0 As usual, good burger and great fries \u2013 which, by the way, were called &#8220;fries&#8221; and not &#8220;chips.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One thing that was different was the size of the crowds.\u00a0 On this Tuesday early afternoon the streets were packed with people.\u00a0 Every step we took outside included dodging people who were busy dodging everyone else.\u00a0 In one store that reminds us of JC Penny, it looked like the Friday after Thanksgiving \u2013 people everywhere &#8211; I have no idea why it was so crowded.<\/p>\n<p>Walking back to our bus stop took us through Piccadilly Gardens, an open, grassy area right in the heart of the city.\u00a0 It was full of people who were sitting or lying on the grass soaking up the sun.\u00a0 By the way, we are more tanned than any of these sun worshippers.\u00a0 In Texas we get more sun by accident than they get on purpose!<\/p>\n<p>We got a bit more walking than we intended \u2013 in part because of our laps around Arndale and also in part because I got turned around and had a hard time finding our bus stop.\u00a0 Finding that stop was harder than you would think because there are probably 50 different stops in a five block radius.\u00a0 Dozens of different bus lines converge at Piccadilly Gardens.\u00a0 By the way, just for future reference, in Manchester Piccadilly Gardens is not the same as Piccadilly Station.\u00a0 The Gardens is in the heart of the shopping district of Manchester and just about every city bus ends up there sooner or later.\u00a0 The Station is the train station which is a 10 minute walk away.<\/p>\n<p>The Adventure continues.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We took advantage of a pretty day to head downtown and do a bit of exploring.\u00a0 Our primary target was the Arndale shopping mall, but we also wanted to look around and get our bearings.\u00a0 It is a 10 minute walk to the bus stop, then a 40 minute ride to the heart of Manchester.\u00a0 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[115,125,162],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4915"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4915"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4915\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4935,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4915\/revisions\/4935"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4915"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4915"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4915"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
