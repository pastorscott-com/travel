Our Spendide washer\/dryer combo handles only small loads and drying time, being limited to 110 volts, is rather slow. We\u2019ve gotten in the habit of washing the clothes and then hanging them out to dry. On a warm, sunny day they dry about as quickly hanging out as they would in the dryer.<\/p>\n<p>The PVC is 3\/4&#8243; and the cost of the whole project including the glue was less than $9. I cut the PVC to size, used the elbows to form the box, drilled holes, and ran the nylon rope. The same nylon rope is used for the &#8220;top&#8221; of the rack. I looped it up over the ladder and then down to attach the &#8220;base&#8221; to the ladder. The whole thing can be put up or taken down in a minute or two. This is an easy project and it will work for people like us who are actually hanging laundry but also for those who just want to hang out swim suits to dry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I hesitate to write about this because there are so many posts on the internet describing varying versions of this, but here\u2019s our new PVC clothes line drying rack.
