We always like CoE parks and this one earns high marks all the way around. The roads are good and the sites are level, paved, and spacious. The views of the lake are just great. Many of the sites have large shelters and all of them have plenty of shade trees. We&#8217;ve enjoyed our 50 amp, full hookup site. The park has a huge boat launch and also group camping\/event facilities. Our Verizon 4G was good and we had a good Dish network satellite signal. We saw deer, turkey, and especially got a kick out of seeing a fox run across the road as we drove in.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2019\/11\/03\/2019-airport-park-coe-waco-tx\/\">A 2019 Review is here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The campground is right by the airport and there is some noise from it. However, we didn&#8217;t find it objectionable and it was quiet overnight. There are interesting things to see and do around Waco. Jackie will do a post about that shortly. I&#8217;ll also mention that Waco has been in the news lately because of some seriously bad stuff going on. We saw none of that and the campground itself is gated with the gates being locked overnight. We had no sense of unease at all in the campground or when out in the community.<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t think of anything I&#8217;d change about Airport Park. The next time we come it won&#8217;t be just because we had to change our plans: we&#8217;ll include it in our plans!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Airport Park is on the northwest side of Waco, right on Lake Waco.
