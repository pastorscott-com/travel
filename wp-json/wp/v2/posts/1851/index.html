As ironic as it may be, going to many commercial RV parks is a poor way to get away from it all.  <\/p>\n<p>The worst crowding we\u2019ve experienced was on the coast of Washington where people were parked next to one another as they would be in a parking lot.  The beautiful Pacific was a short walk away and people were willing to be packed into a campground to be in such a prime spot near the beach.  The house and city lot we sold a few years ago was just a modest place on an average property.  I think, though, that in that Washington campground there were six RVs packed into a spot the size of that city lot.  <\/p>\n<p>Not only is spacing an issue at many campgrounds, but RVers want to be outside so there are lawn chairs and campfires everywhere.  Thinking about the house we sold, imagine what it would have been like if day after day my five closest neighbors came to my back yard to each build their own campfire and, while being cordial to one another, didn\u2019t want to spend that time together with their other neighbors.  And, of course, each would bring their dogs who would be out of their element and tending to bark at one another and the other folks in my yard.  Meanwhile their kids would be having a great time, riding their bikes up and down the roads and sometimes through where other groups are sitting.<\/p>\n<p>So, people put themselves into the crowded conditions of the typical commercial campground and then complain about the behavior of others.  Of course, they are right \u2013 people are being noisy and rude, acting as if they are at home with plenty of space to call their own.  At the same time, if you pick a crowded campground for your get-away weekend you might want to remind yourself that you aren\u2019t at home.  If you don\u2019t want to hear barking dogs, slamming doors, yelling kids, and even quiet campfire conversations next door you might want to avoid crowded campgrounds.  If you do go to such places, well, remember that you aren\u2019t at home where you can get away from all that kind of stuff.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One recurring theme I see on the RV Facebook groups is the behavior (or better, misbehavior) of fellow campers.
