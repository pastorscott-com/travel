They have tons of Old El Paso products in the store) how big is a 226 gram jar?\u00a0 The answer is &#8220;not very!&#8221;\u00a0 Easy enough when standing in the store, more of a challenge when looking at a picture online.\u00a0 Or, want some black olives?\u00a0 That looks like a nice jar \u2013 450 grams can&#8217;t be that much can it?\u00a0 So, we&#8217;ve ended up with a small jar of taco sauce, a giant sized jar of black olives, and an abundance of (pureed none the less) canned spinach.\u00a0 Oh well, we&#8217;ll put more taco sauce on the next order \u2013 they will bring it right to us.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, as someone once said, &#8220;Britain and America are two nations divided by a common language.&#8221;\u00a0 Want to make hamburgers?\u00a0 You want &#8220;minced beef&#8221; from the store.\u00a0 Jackie wanted to buy some rubbing alcohol for our medicine cabinet.\u00a0 The lady at the pharmacy (or &#8220;chemist&#8221;) counter looked a bit confused and said they don&#8217;t have any alcohol there.\u00a0 After a bit of confusion we discovered that what we wanted was &#8220;surgical spirits.&#8221;\u00a0 No doubt, this is but the tip of the iceberg.<\/p>\n<p>Till next time, &#8220;cheers!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our adventures in shopping continue.\u00a0 In traveling to the UK we could bring with us only what could be checked on the plane.\u00a0 Of course, we focused on clothing, personal items, and electronics.\u00a0 That left us needing to purchase many kitchen items (although our new kitchen has all the basics provided).\u00a0 Also, all the minor [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[2,3],"tags":[162],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4901"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4901"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4901\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4905,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4901\/revisions\/4905"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4901"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4901"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4901"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
