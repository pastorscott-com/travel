If others prefer free lancing it is fine with me, but that&#8217;s not my thing.  I get a kick out of searching the web for the best campgrounds in interesting places and within our budget.  As has been reported on many fronts, one unexpected impact of Covid has been a surge in the popularity of RVing.  Sales reached record highs and campgrounds began to experience record occupancy.<\/p>\n<p>Our 2021 Adventure has been delayed a bit as we prepare to celebrate a family event but we are looking forward to getting underway in a bit over a month.  Knowing that campgrounds are filling up, I have spent time researching campgrounds and destinations, planning our route, and then reserving camp sites. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written before about planning: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2016\/06\/27\/planner-or-freelancer\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/12\/27\/travel-planning-i-confess-im-a-planner\/\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>For instance, this coming winter we want to spend some time in Arizona.  There are an amazing number of places there that cater to winter RVers.  I spent considerable time checking the information on websites and reading reviews.  Once I narrowed my choice down and actually called about vacancies (still 7-8 months out!) I found that many places I had marked as good possibilities reported no room in the inn!  Now, if I wanted to spend $1000 a month I would have no problem finding a spot (well, probably not, since our rig isn&#8217;t new enough), but trying to stay within a reasonable budget puts us in competition with lots of other RVing retirees.<\/p>\n<p>We finally settled on a spot and made our deposit.  As of right now, we are booked up for practically every night the rest of the year.  For even me this level of planning is a bit over the top, but it sure beats landing in an area for a week or two and being told that there are no vacancies. <\/p>\n<p>Personally, I think this is just how it is going to be from now on.  Not only are many discovering RVing but many campgrounds are selling sites for long term use.  Like it or lump it planning is going to be a part of the fulltime RV lifestyle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve always mostly enjoyed the planning part of fulltiming.
