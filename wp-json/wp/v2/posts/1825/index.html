I think it\u2019s kind of sad that there are so many nice sites with empty trailers sitting on them while traveling members have just a few spots to pick from. This is nothing against people who take advantage of the deal but I do wish more consideration was given to regular members.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve enjoyed the company of our good friends Ron and Theresa Corwin. They are traveling from the east and we are traveling from the north and we met here for these two weeks. Ron willingly took on some projects on our camper and for that I am very grateful. We also enjoyed lots of fun fellowship with them during our stay. To make things even better, Jackie\u2019s brother Jim, and his wife, Phyllis came to visit her mother who lives nearby. It was lots of fun to spend time with them.<\/p>\n<p>This is a quiet campground &#8211; a nice place for leisurely walks and evening campfires. We also enjoyed a concert by the Weaver Believer band.<\/p>\n<p>Since we did a <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/07\/05\/campground-review-wilmington-oh-thousand-trails\/\">review of this campground with lots of photos<\/a> and some of the area sights, especially our time at the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/07\/01\/national-museum-of-the-usaf-dayton-oh\/\">National Museum of the Air Force<\/a>, on our previous visit I\u2019ll not repeat the same information here but I will mention that I&#8217;ve added some photos to the campground photo album. We do like this campground and expect to return for future visits.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRuu7-MLzAv_D9t7G9CYLbkoyCZSWIvNa-bjxoWbahLfn06P1xg3gIZimjFNRnU2Cz9rEQItK5OZA7f\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The common Thousand Trails issue of many of the more desirable sites being rented out to long term residents is in play here.
