It turned out that our stay was shortened by a day. The campground is reasonably near I81, nestled in the Middle River valley. The campground is all about that river, which is a gentle stream, perfect for tubing most of the time. Then, near the popular tenting area is the real gem of the campground: a beautiful waterfall dropping in from the higher ground opposite the campground. Again, our stay was brief and in the week following heavy rains from what was Hurricane Florence. With the river running high (and it was flooding the campground in the days prior to our arrival), the waterfall was stunning.<\/p>\n<p>There is a camping area on the plateau above the large camping area on the river; that&#8217;s where we stayed. Really, we were glad to be a bit higher, knowing that the river was pretty full and that more rain was forecast. My thinking was that even if the river overflowed its banks again we would be high enough to be clear of any danger. After the Hurricane Florence related flooding the campground staff worked many hours putting fresh gravel down throughout the large water-front area of the campground which is all gravel \u2013 roads and campsites.<\/p>\n<p>This is a destination campground with a large, heated pool and several hot tubs located indoors. There&#8217;s also a nice fishing lake and a couple of playgrounds. The kids have a blast bike riding, fishing, tubing, swimming, and feeding the many mostly-tame rabbits.<\/p>\n<p>WiFi is slow and only available in the campground store.\u00a0 My Verizon signal was poor to zero.\u00a0 I got a satellite signal but not many people would.\u00a0 Having a homestyle dish on a tripod let me set up in the only sweet spot, just peeking over the trees to the south of us.\u00a0 The sites themselves are pretty tight with neighbors very close in on both sides.<\/p>\n<p>As I said, our stay was supposed to be three nights but after a night of rain on Saturday night a staff member knocked on our door telling us that the entire campground was being evicted by the sheriff&#8217;s office. The issue wasn&#8217;t flooding in the campground. Rather, it was the county road leading to the campground that was in danger of going underwater. We were told that we needed to be out within the hour.<\/p>\n<p>So, we skipped breakfast and gave up on attending church and began preparing to move. It usually takes us a bit less than an hour to be ready to pull out. In this case, we were ready to go in around 40 minutes. The road out was fine, but there is one section that dips down right beside the river for a 100 yards or so. Water was lapping against the pavement as we came through.<\/p>\n<p>For us, it was more of an inconvenience than anything else and we just moved down the highway to our next scheduled stop. I do feel sorry for the campground especially in light of all the work they did to get open again following the flooding.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRFTdNbEuhbwhsHaeY286srsNtKaQ5aE9CRjrF8jHpB1TJY8dYMlBf1ogyokTWGLXbALG9XxEH3Sy3B\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/hAo7Lky5dpRk9bwq9\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We only intended on spending three nights at Shenandoah Valley Campground, Verona, VA.
