The views are amazing all the way along. There are many pull offs where one can absorb the views and take lots of photographs.\u00a0 There are welcome areas with restaurants with gift shops along the way but we opted to pack a lunch and eat at one of the overlooks. \u00a0We were lucky enough to see a few deer and actually saw a black bear.\u00a0 By the time we could get turned around in hopes of getting a better look the bear had moved back into the trees. Scott just loved the drive and I agree that it is a great way to spend a day.<\/p>\n<p>Being in this historic area I had to visit a little of the Civil War History. \u00a0There&#8217;s a full driving tour but we chose to see a very small portion. We saw the cottage of Belle Boyd who was a Confederate spy, Williams Chapel CME which was finished in 1845, and the home of a young woman named Lucy Buck who daughter of a prosperous planter and kept a diary throughout the Civil War.\u00a0 We also visited Prospect Hill Cemetery where in 1882 the remains of 276 soldiers of the former Confederacy are interred. Ninety of the soldiers are identified and buried in a circle and the others are buried in a common grave in the center where an 18 foot high monument is erected above them.\u00a0 The cemetery is a sobering reminder of the tragedy of war.<\/p>\n<p>Our stay in this area has been quite enjoyable stay and we recommend it for both it&#8217;s scenery and it&#8217;s history.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTyZK29oGYQFhMmBCYTlDLQbajg6WGwl1sPpV9Dn--eY1xUjJY5psjnptjhRcuDMeRkMZF7nzNtmy3z\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Our day at Shenandoah National Park driving Skyline Drive was a fun day trip. \u00a0We drove down a state highway south around 60 miles and then entered the park to travel the two lane twisting Skyline Drive back to Front Royal.
