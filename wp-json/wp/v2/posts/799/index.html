Now, I\u2019m happy to add my recommendation for this beautiful park. The \u201cpoint\u201d in this case is a point of land looking out over the canyons that include Canyonlands National Park, as much as 2000 feet below. Many have compared this view with that of the Grand Canyon, high praise indeed. Every day this state park is filled with people who include the superlative view at the \u201cpoint\u201d in their trip to the national park.<\/p>\n<p>The campground is very popular and a prospective camper will want to make reservations well in advance of arrival, although there are just a few drive up sites available. Generally speaking, the campground is full night after night. There are only 25 sites and only around a third of them will accommodate a larger camper. I saw one 40\u2019 motorhome arrive about dark. They looked at their site, realized they would never fit, and drove on out of the park. (Hopefully, they knew about the BLM Horsethief Campground nearby.) Also, the sites aren\u2019t especially level. Most of them lean to the front or to the back but are okay side to side. Our 35\u2019 5th wheel pretty much used all the room available in our pull through site.<\/p>\n<p>My Verizon phone worked, but data was intermittent and at times neither 3G nor 4G worked, even using a signal booster. At other times, I had a fairly decent data flow.<\/p>\n<p>The sites all have 50 amp power, no water, and no sewer. Also, there is no water for a RV\u2019s fresh water tanks in the campground. The nearest camper water tank fill up is available at the Shell station\/RV park 20 miles away at the intersection of Highways 191 and 313.<\/p>\n<p>However, I\u2019ll add that there are modern, flush toilets in the campground. Also, there\u2019s a sink with running water where dishes can be washed and drinking water containers can be filled. There\u2019s also a dump station with a water faucet that can be used to rinse hoses, etc.<\/p>\n<p>If you can get a spot that you can fit in, Dead Horse Point State Park is a terrific base of operations for visits to Canyonlands and Arches National Parks and the Moab area in general. It\u2019s not only handy for touring the area, but it\u2019s a destination in its own right.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Everywhere I looked on the internet people recommended Dead Horse Point State Park near Moab, UT.
