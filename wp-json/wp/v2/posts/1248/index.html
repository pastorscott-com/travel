I think we have some power lines down on our branch of the blessed electrical tree and that means we have to wait till they get the easier ones up and running before they look our way. The storm was overnight Friday and we are now at the following Thursday morning. There may have been a truck from the electric company here, but if there was I missed it. I\u2019m not complaining but I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the power back on. Meanwhile, a lot of people in the community are getting power and some gas stations are opening up. The result, for us, is more noise than ever. Apparently, as folks get power they loan their generators to the less fortunate in our neighborhood. People know they can get fuel, so there is no effort to spare the gas. One neighbor was given a big and old welding machine for power. She already had a couple of small and quiet generators, but now she\u2019s running this workhorse. You can\u2019t carry on a conversation in the front yard without practically shouting. These are nice people but it\u2019s frustrating to have all the windows open so the nice cool air can come in and having the racket of at least four generators, one of which dominates all the others. I\u2019ve probably spent too much time in state park campgrounds where people value quietness and being outdoors.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2008\/09\/18\/hurricane-ike-6-the-morning-after\/\">Lots of photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re still waiting on electricity.
