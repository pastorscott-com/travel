post office to be a big one.\u00a0 Boy, was I wrong!\u00a0 This post office consists of two windows in the back of a small Subway restaurant!\u00a0 Had we not had a guide we would have walked right past it!\u00a0 Within minutes of arriving we not only had our ID cards, but we had our sandwiches too!\u00a0 On that front, I&#8217;ll mention that a Subway sandwich is pretty much the same here as at home.\u00a0 However, I noticed that there are no diet drinks or an ice dispenser on the drink machine.\u00a0 The British think Americans are kind of weird paying for a drink that is mostly ice!<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of sodas, I see that a can of soda here is 330 milliliters.\u00a0 A can in the US is 12 ounces.\u00a0 So Americans get about 341 milliliters when they buy a can of soda.\u00a0 Obviously, that&#8217;s an 11 milliliter advantage to the USA!<\/p>\n<p>From there we headed on into the main city centre, followed by a trip back out to &#8220;home&#8221; on the tram (light rail).\u00a0 It is faster than the bus, but the station is just a bit farther from the campus than is the bus stop.<\/p>\n<p>Living without a car is going to require a bit more planning.\u00a0 For instance, it&#8217;s rather depressing to get home and realize you forgot to pick up the bread.\u00a0 At that point getting the bread will require a 10-15 minute walk each way.\u00a0 Maybe we&#8217;ll just do without until the next trip out!<\/p>\n<p>Also, we keep getting caught without shopping bags.\u00a0 This isn&#8217;t completely new to us as we&#8217;ve experienced the same thing on the west coast, but no store supplies bags for things you buy.\u00a0 Of course, you can buy a plastic bag at the counter, but having to pay for the bags make you want to bring your own.\u00a0 Two or three times now I&#8217;ve bought something and found myself standing there waiting for the sales person to put our purchases in a bag.\u00a0 Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve looked at me wondering why I haven\u2019t bagged the items and moved on!<\/p>\n<p>Everyone seems to use their credit cards for purchases with cash being seldom used.\u00a0 Most of the time you just place the card over the &#8220;touchless&#8221; symbol on the machine.\u00a0 When it lights up, the charge is complete.\u00a0 I&#8217;m glad I upgraded my card to an &#8220;international&#8221; one.\u00a0 For an extra $30 a year I pay no foreign transaction fees.\u00a0 Otherwise, an extra 3% would be added to every purchase.\u00a0 As it is, we have to pay the exchange rate which isn\u2019t in our favor.\u00a0 One pound is around $1.20.\u00a0 I&#8217;m just rounding purchases up in my mind so for every \u00a34.00 I think &#8220;$5.00.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned jet lag earlier.\u00a0 We are getting closer to the new normal, although if we wake up in the night it can be hard getting back to sleep.\u00a0 It may be, though, that rather than jet lag our weariness is related to walking to the store, up and down the stairs, and around campus.\u00a0 I walk a lot, and step-wise I&#8217;m not doing any more steps than I usually do.\u00a0 However, my legs are tired and a bit sore.\u00a0 I remember feeling the same when we visited London years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Again, I expect my post frequency to slow down as time goes by, but with everything new it is fun to share our adventure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ll start our volunteering activities next week so we&#8217;re trying to take care of settling in, getting our bearings, and trying to conquer lingering jet lag.
