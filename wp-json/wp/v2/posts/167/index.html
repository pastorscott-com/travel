We\u2019ve had just a short visit here before moving on to the central part of the state.  We are at this resort as members of RPI (Resort Parks International) so our price is quite reasonable.  The primary draw of the resort is a pretty lake and pond.  The sites are standard size for a commercial park and the sites, in fact, the entire property is quite level.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a great pool and activity center that has a small store, a grill, laundry, and workout center.  We\u2019ve enjoyed the plentiful shade and have taken several leisurely walks.  The park has many seasonal residents who have made various improvements to their sites.  However, it was no problem finding a good site.<\/p>\n<p>Again, the site sizes are fairly standard for a commercial park and had we had neighbors on either side of us it would have felt rather crowded.  As it was there happened to be no one on either side or behind us, so the site felt comfortably big.<\/p>\n<p>The resort is bounded by the lake on one side and then large fields of corn and soybeans on the other sides.  This is farming country and the fields feel just right for this part of the world.<\/p>\n<p>The resort has good WiFi but they charge extra for it.  I have a pretty good 4G signal and I\u2019ve been using it for a reasonably fast connect.  They offer 50 amps for an extra price.<\/p>\n<p>I can see why area people might want to make this a destination camping spot for a family camping trip.  For us, it has been a pleasant three day stop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos A few miles east of Moline, Illinois just off of I88 is Sunset Lakes Resort.
