Since I did a <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018\/07\/15\/2018-timothy-lake-south-thousand-trails-marshalls-creek-pa\/\">review of Timothy Lake South<\/a> at that time I thought we could do a drive through of Timothy Lake North and post a few photos. We didn&#8217;t camp there so I won&#8217;t attempt a review. I can say that we didn&#8217;t see many campsites as most of the campground has been given over to permanent units. What campsites we did see were on the smaller, more cramped side. There is, though, a nice pool and playground. On future trips to the area, I think we&#8217;ll stay with Timothy Lake South.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSzEHGJoKJM4BtD9_yILs0Vn90vE7c5WGhdmv3sxsqllQUcmDXpmb-KDsYncd3r_VrC6xZuxZ0rHEam\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-ksImRCYXAxk\/W39rgIlrYvI\/AAAAAAAA1V8\/JCvJA6DBCoU3698SKIXEtGDTUYBnf5xGACKgBGAs\/s1600\/IMG_20171220_171125.jpg\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Thousand Trails Campground is located about a mile from Timothy Lake South, where we are staying for the second time in just a few weeks.
