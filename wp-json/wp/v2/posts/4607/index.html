Frankly, the 300 mile drive is longer than we like traveling in a day.  Our desire for a nice, yet inexpensive spot along I45 brought us to High View CoE on Bardwell Lake at Ennis, TX.  The campground is about 10 minutes from the Interstate, and with our America the Beautiful Pass the price is right.  One night stops aren&#8217;t our cup of tea, but this campground is just about right for a short stop between north Texas and Houston.  <\/p>\n<p>The sites offer 50 amps and water.  However, the water hookups are well behind the sites, so bring plenty of water hose.  Since our stop was a short one, we didn&#8217;t explore the entire campground, but in the first section there are only 10 or so sites that will accomodate a larger rig.  We were in site 09 and it worked out just fine for us.  The sites on the side of the road toward the lake are mostly short and downhill toward the lake.  They would make good tent sites but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to put a bigger rig into them.  When reserving online pay attention to site length!<\/p>\n<p>We were told that the place was really hopping over the weekend.  Our Monday night stay was very quiet.  There were no campers anywhere near us.<\/p>\n<p>I think High View will be on our list as a decent overnight as we drive between the Thousand Trails campgrounds.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQa-P1NsT9C0uf8xp_S8DJc3CIdkKJX_mo1349BPIQ6jhtEWjoJzsN6ID0FTtwRZgz0yXv-ANtIioPb\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have traveled between Lake Conroe Thousand Trails and Lake Texoma Thousand Trails a few times.
