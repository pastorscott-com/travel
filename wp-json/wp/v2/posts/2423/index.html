There are several old buildings, still in use, that were part of that operation. The campground has a variety of sites, ranging from long full hookup pull-throughs down to no-hookup tenting sites. This campground accepts reservations and also offers weekly and monthly rates. There are both 30 and 50 amps sites and we were charged a couple of dollars extra for a 50. Many of the sites offer great views of Lake Kampeska. The pull-through sites are near the lake, but the hookups are shared so you end up back to back and face to face with your neighbors. Considering how long the sites are, that\u2019s probably not much of an issue. Another section of full hookups are back in, shady sites, but not along the lake. That\u2019s where we stayed. Several water\/electric sites are close to the lake, really, some of the nicest sites in the park. It was a struggle because of our location, but I did manage to get the primary eastern arc Dish Network satellite (there was no chance of getting the western ones). I think it would have been a piece of cake to get satellite in any of the pull-throughs. My Verizon signal was good, offering fast data speeds. Being that the campground is around 12 miles west of I29, it\u2019s probably not a good candidate for an overnight stop for those traveling north or south on the interstate. Still, it\u2019s a pretty nice campground if it fits your travel plans.<\/p>\n<p>On a related note, our arrival in South Dakota was a milestone for us. South Dakota completed our goal of visiting all 50 states! Not all of that was done in the RV but through the years, we\u2019ve been privileged to at least set foot in all the states. Pretty cool, huh!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTRExNAJ61vYUyKLaOG3uUkOUhaO_FyGQ4TWP-xaJIrrH8GX7z5zQxq865QJ0yqnO1ht9TOvvrgwSpA\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I understand it Codington County Memorial Park, Watertown, SD, was originally a YMCA property.
