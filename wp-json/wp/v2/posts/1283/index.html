Four hundred miles later we are in LaGrange, GA.  We didn&#8217;t think about the time change, so instead of arriving shortly after 7:00 local time it was after 8:00.  For the second night in a row I sat up in the dark.  Still we have caught up with our original schedule.<\/p>\n<p>It seems funny to be here in the Hoofer&#8217;s campground with a southern gospel concert going on a couple of hundred feet away.  In fact, they use the campground for parking and we ended up camping in the corner of the campground because the rest of the campground is filled with concert goers&#8217; cars.  The campground is nothing to brag about.  Basically it is a grassy field with hookups.  Some of the sites are just plain on the side of a hill.
