some dropping over 1000 feet and many were quite large.\u00a0 At times, the mountains on either side were higher than could be seen looking out the windows.\u00a0 We saw, literally, hundreds of waterfalls.\u00a0 Ultimately, we arrived at the glacier.\u00a0 It was taller than Mendenhall, which we saw the day before.\u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t believe how close the ship came to the face of Dawes Glacier.\u00a0 In anticipation of the scenery, Jackie and I had staked out a couple of window seats on deck 11 and it turned out to be the perfect place.\u00a0 We took over 200 photos, although I managed to cull the number down quite a bit.\u00a0 The trip back out enabled us to see the opposite side of the Arm and weather conditions had improved a bit so the photos we took on the way out were somewhat brighter than those we took going in.<\/p>\n<p>Back out in the Inside Passage we saw several dolphin and a few whales.\u00a0 We decided to skip the main dining hall again and eat at the Windjammer buffet.\u00a0 By being there when they opened the doors we were able to get a window table right at the front of the ship.\u00a0 The view from there was neat and we even saw a couple of whales as we ate a leisurely supper.\u00a0 All in all, in spite of the change of itinerary and the inclement weather, we thoroughly enjoyed the day.\u00a0 Because of the diversion, we were told we were headed to Ketchikan on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>I was rather disappointed when the ship began to rock and roll mid evening.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure, but I think we went back out into the open sea for the overnight journey.\u00a0 Maybe it has something to do with opening the Casino.\u00a0 Also, there was some kind of poker tournament going on during the cruise.\u00a0 Since the pre-cruise information said we were supposed to cruise the Inside Passage on our journey south and I couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed that we were, once again, moving out of sight of land.\u00a0 About 9:30 I went to bed to escape some of the discomfort of walking around in the up and down, back and forth motion of the ship.\u00a0 Jackie and I had no problem with sea sickness, but after a while I started feeling somewhat dizzy.\u00a0 Just in case I took some motion sickness pills and then, in the night, I ate a few Rolaids.<\/p>\n<p>[pe2-gallery album=&#8221;http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/data\/feed\/base\/user\/101128941131953400860\/albumid\/5371405647577144433?alt=rss&amp;hl=en_US&amp;kind=photo&#8221;
