We especially enjoyed having our grandson, Matt, with us for our visit there. At the visitors&#8217; center there are several dioramas, a touch table with bones, rocks, antlers and other items.  There is also an area with live snakes, tadpoles, and a baby alligator.  Just an easy walk from the Visitors Center is a short trail with stairs is an overlook of the Arkansas River.  We enjoyed the view and while there we saw six deer come out of the trees below and cross the field. From there we drove over to the Arkansas arboretum. The paths are paved and along the trail are markers with the names of trees with several stops that have a self-powered, hand crank machines that you crank and to hear recordings of facts about the area. We took a short walk to a river overlook with a bench.  I highly recommend this day use park.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRdTfJw5GjLX8nKnlBQMvIVpuCq-snmA8-596opiFwxX62HZqQZb4xDoeWe8d3q_G9o-8-yUufjdqAJ\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pinnacle Mountain State Park is just a short drive from our campground, Maumelle CoE Park and at Little Rock, AR.
