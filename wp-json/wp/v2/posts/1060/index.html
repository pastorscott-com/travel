Using our Passport America discount we paid $17.50 and were assigned one of the drive through sites.  We have 50 amp, full hookups although the sewer is way at the back of the site and situated in such a way that it is almost uphill from the camper.<\/p>\n<p>We have neighbors just a few feet away on either side of us and some kind of discount Marriott motel is looking down on us from across the street.  Still, for an overnight this works just fine.  The restrooms are clean, the roads are paved, the interstate is just a few minutes away, and the sites are pretty level.  The campground offers free WiFi but I found it very slow and went back to my Verizon 4G.  There are restaurants in walking distance.  For an &#8220;in town&#8221; RV park that can be had for the price we&#8217;re paying it will do just fine.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSscNRvAcWg5uNKkgWfHpjxoxqli35tRv8_EHL0Mrd_Kzg7WyYUGkbFhp7ZilVQX3y5CvlknwzFjE-z\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a 300 mile drive across the Mojave desert &#8211; past the famous mothballed aircraft field, Edwards AFB, Boron (and Twenty Mule Team Road) &#8211; we arrived at Sunrise RV park in Kingman, AZ for a one night stay.
