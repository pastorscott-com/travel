In 1848 John Deere moved his plow manufacturing business here from Grand Detour, IL. It has expanded to become an International organization with manufacturing and marketing facilities around the world.  We wanted to take the factory tour but they were completely booked for the day so we went to the John Deere Pavilion and Store.  The Pavilion has some antique tractors including the Waterloo Boy tractor with metal wheels and ran on Kerosene.  They had a wheat harvester, forestry equipment as well as an autonomous tractor that uses GPS technology.  The store is in an adjoining building. It has toys, games and clothing with John Deere logo including cute pink shirts and hats for the girls.<\/p>\n<p>We finished there and drove down River Road along the Mississippi River.  The water taxis and paddle wheelers were not running today because the river is at flood stage but not into the road at this time.<\/p>\n<p>Deere &#038; Company World Headquarters on One John Deere Place is a beautiful building designed by architect Eero Saarinen.  It is set in wooded surroundings and is beautiful.  In the lower level there are more antique tractors and plows along with heavy equipment and large harvesters. I am amazed at the size of the some of the equipment used now when compared to the old tractors and plows that were pulled by horses or oxen.   We saw the golden plow that was at various World fairs and trade shows.  Along one entire wall the history of the Company is shown with other historical memorabilia starting in the 1800\u2019s. <\/p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun visiting John Deere and recommend it as a great place to spend an afternoon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We went to Moline, IL this afternoon and visited some of the John Deere facilities in the area.
