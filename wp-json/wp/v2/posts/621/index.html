and sometimes we do, but we like going to a local church. \u00a0Honestly, we miss our church family.\u00a0 Going to church as perpetual visitors isn\u2019t the same as being regular attenders.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s our approach: after searching the web for an area church of our denominational flavor we look over the church\u2019s web site for service times and directions.\u00a0 We look for photos of people at a regular worship service so we have a better idea of the unwritten dress code.\u00a0 Like most anyone, we just want to fit in and not be too casual or too formal.\u00a0 When I was a kid people wore their \u201cSunday best\u201d to church.\u00a0 These days, not so much.\u00a0 That makes it challenging to know just what to wear.\u00a0 Also, we check the church calendar to see if there is a special event that Sunday.\u00a0 If so, depending on the event, it might make us more or less likely to attend that particular week (VBS program, less likely \u2013 southern gospel concert, oh yeah!).\u00a0 Often, the church with a website that provides us the above information is the one we visit.\u00a0 \u00a0By the way, the church that is still promoting last winter\u2019s Christmas program in July automatically loses potential as a likely place for our visit.<\/p>\n<p>If our own denomination has no nearby church, we look for a \u201csister\u201d group, but really, we\u2019re pretty comfortable in a wide variety of churches.<\/p>\n<p>We try to arrive at the church just a few minutes early.\u00a0 If we are too early we find ourselves sitting uncomfortably in a less than full sanctuary.\u00a0 If we arrive late, we fear we\u2019ll interrupt a service already in progress.\u00a0 You\u2019d be surprised at how often we\u2019ve arrived at churches not knowing for sure which parking lot to use or even which door to enter.\u00a0 That\u2019s especially true with large churches with multiple buildings on their campus or with older churches that have an old sanctuary and newer buildings around it.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve concluded that most churches are completely unprepared for walk in visitors.\u00a0 They are comfortable with people who attend as a guest of a regular who is \u201cshowing them the ropes\u201d but walk-ins are unexpected and unanticipated.\u00a0 After being the ultimate church \u201cinsiders\u201d we\u2019ve realized just how uncomfortable walk-in visitors are during a meet and greet time.\u00a0 Everyone is told to stand and greet those around them.\u00a0 We stand and say a brief hello to those around us and then remain standing with fixed smiles while everyone around us has short private conversations as friends do at such a time.\u00a0 Even churches that think they are friendly are mostly just friendly with one another, not with outsiders.<\/p>\n<p>One eye opener for me, as a career pastor, has been the demeanor of pastors.\u00a0 When we first arrive they come up to shake hands and smile, telling us how glad they are we have visited.\u00a0 Then, they always ask, \u201cAre you from around here?\u201d\u00a0 When we say we aren\u2019t the light goes out and they quickly move on, sometimes with hardly another word.\u00a0 I know how busy a pastor is on a Sunday morning, but this response to our not being \u201cprospects\u201d was surprisingly consistent wherever we visited and were greeted by the pastor.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all that I want to add that, in general, we enjoy visiting churches.\u00a0 As a retired pastor I often remind myself that I\u2019m attending church as a worshiper.\u00a0 I\u2019m not there to look for interesting ideas or to \u201cfix\u201d the church.\u00a0 In addition, we\u2019ve been impressed by how many good preachers and singers there are.\u00a0 We\u2019ve enjoyed the variety and seeing the good that is being done in churches around the country.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t been unusual for us to drive away from a worship service and remark to one another, \u201cIf we lived here we could be a part of that church.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>We miss our church family and friends.\u00a0 We\u2019re very aware that there\u2019s a depth of spiritual life that is best fostered by being a faithful part of a good church family.\u00a0 Also, we\u2019re glad for social media and the ability it provides for keeping up with what is happening \u201cback home.\u201d\u00a0 At the same time we\u2019re enjoying our travels and the many opportunities to worship with the larger Church with a capitol \u201cC.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since retiring and becoming fulltime traveling RVers we\u2019ve become church hoppers.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s quite a change from being the parsonage couple and attending our local church every time the doors are open.
