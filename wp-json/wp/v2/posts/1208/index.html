outside the tourist area in, instead, the &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; of London. \u00a0The cost was about the same as a tiny room in a &#8220;city&#8221; hotel but the\u00a0accommodations\u00a0are much better. \u00a0One of the main things to think about when planning a London trip is that the tube gives you great access to everything. \u00a0If you are close to a tube station you&#8217;re never far from the rest of London. \u00a0By staying at Canary Wharf we&#8217;ve had easy access to a great shopping center with plenty of shops and restaurants plus easy access to the tube, the light rail, the river commuter services &#8211; all with Greenwich 10 minutes away one direction and the Tower of London 10 minutes away the other.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em;
