&nbsp;She looked it over and then we wandered through the mall before deciding to have some Thai food for lunch. &nbsp;We had a nice rice\/chicken\/spices meal along with a couple of pots of tea. &nbsp;It was quite good and filling.<\/p>\n<p>After lunch we walked over the a community park that is situated right on the Thames. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a very nice walkway along the river and we strolled there for awhile before returning to the flat to finish up laundry.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

outside the tourist area in, instead, the &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; of London. &nbsp;The cost was about the same as a tiny room in a &#8220;city&#8221; hotel but the&nbsp;accommodations&nbsp;are much better. &nbsp;One of the main things to think about when planning a London trip is that the tube gives you great access to everything. &nbsp;If you are close to a tube station you&#8217;re never far from the rest of London. &nbsp;By staying at Canary Wharf we&#8217;ve had easy access to a great shopping center with plenty of shops and restaurants plus easy access to the tube, the light rail, the river commuter services &#8211; all with Greenwich 10 minutes away one direction and the Tower of London 10 minutes away the other.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/2011-London-9-27-2011-9-00-25-AM.jpg\" style=\"clear: left;
