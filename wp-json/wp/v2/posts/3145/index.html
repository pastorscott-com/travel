We saw many photos and artifacts starting with the very beginning at the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association where, in 1891 James Naismith invented an indoor game to be played at the YMCA.  We followed the evolution of the sport from events like the introduction of the sport to women up through the most current inductees. Along with the many displays are interactive sites where you can check your height and arm span compared to famous athletes or see what one&#8217;s vertical jump is. My favorite displays were the early women\u2019s uniforms and the peach baskets.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSTPhAnHC-HTUE0uv_pyHBfgPJO-MIKr5qP80Z9aqjUn5zK8SIMcKltny_EVxxI_HddkRD0k8cbyg6V\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/h7pQWhF7zEy5zPYY7\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a> <\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had an interesting visit to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.
