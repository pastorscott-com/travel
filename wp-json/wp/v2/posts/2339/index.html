The campground is named in honor of John Chapman who was better known as Johnny Appleseed, the frontiersman, preacher, humanitarian, and nurseryman who introduced apple trees to this region of our nation.  He lived his later years out in Fort Wayne and is buried near what is now a park and campground named in his honor.  This campground gets high marks from most everyone and that now includes us.  The park has lots of shady water\/electric sites near the St. Joseph River.  The strip of land between the campground and the River boasts a large dog park and playground and the street is busy with joggers, bicyclists, and others who come to enjoy the area.  The campground has a very nice and clean shower house and laundry room which has a dump station beside it.  For those who are staying longer there\u2019s a \u201choney wagon service\u201d for a reasonable $10.  The sites are a mixed bag \u2013 some that will only accommodate smaller rigs.  You may want to bring an extra water hose along because many of the sites share a water spigot which is equally unhandy to everyone.  Having said that, we could have fit into most of the sites.  The one we were given was one of three sites that backs in directly off the city street.  Frankly, I think our site is probably the best one in the place!  Before I close out my review, I have to tell you the name of that street.  No, it isn\u2019t \u201cJohnny Appleseed\u201d street.  Rather, it is named for a beloved Fort Wayne mayor of the past who proudly embraced his name and used it to his advantage in political campaigns.  His name was Harry Baals and, yes, it\u2019s pronounced with one \u201ca\u201d and two \u201cl\u2019s.\u201d <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTLigDF-eZi_S7W7_e9TnTkBIZ3149UbbyCZvPkAcrprS0KgJEc1nzTFYjZ_PhSsqNWx4cdN6JNa2g6\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our stay in Johnny Appleseed Campground in Fort Wayne, Indiana has been a pleasant one.
