Of course, everyone has their own particular concerns: family needs, events, appointments and the like.  If possible, though, I&#8217;d be looking into suitable long term parking.<\/p>\n<p>And, while I&#8217;m writing, I&#8217;ll switch to my pastoral identity for a moment.\u00a0 From a health point of view, we&#8217;re urged to wash our hands to protect against a virus infection.\u00a0 From a spiritual point of view, I urge you to spend time with the Lord \u2013 maybe whispering a 20 second prayer each time you wash your hands \u2013 pray for our world and for ourselves and those we love.\u00a0 Ask the Lord to protect you against the infection of fear and anxiety that is sweeping across the world.  Also, you might include a prayer of thanksgiving for running water and soap.  Oh yeah, also pray for our President and other national leaders; maybe health care providers and medical researchers too.<\/p>\n<p>Come to think of it, you might need more than 20 seconds for those prayers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The coronavirus outbreak is a fluid situation.\u00a0 Today&#8217;s guidance from officials may be outdated by this evening.\u00a0 To some extent we are all just waiting for the next domino to fall.\u00a0 Fulltime RVers aren&#8217;t exempt from all the uncertainty.\u00a0 The other day I saw a meme on Facebook picturing a class C parked alone on [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[49,50,108,110],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4538"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4538"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4538\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4539,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4538\/revisions\/4539"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4538"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4538"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4538"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
