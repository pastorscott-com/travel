really not enough to even have a decent phone conversation.\u00a0 That left us dependent on the park&#8217;s WiFi.\u00a0 By staying in the section of the campground closer to the Activity Center we had slow, but somewhat useable internet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, to our surprise, when I went to plug in the electric we had 50 amps &#8211; something not even listed on the campground map.<\/p>\n<p>We were disappointed and surprised at how far it really is to Yosemite valley.\u00a0 Even though a National Park entrance is only five miles from the campground it&#8217;s actually about 30 miles down to the valley &#8211; and those miles are twisting, turning, and sometimes steep miles.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s a tip: the YARTS bus stops right at the campground and will take you to Yosemite valley.\u00a0 The cost for the two of us was actually about what we would have spent on fuel driving in and out.\u00a0 I suggest you drive in and see the more distant sites and then ride the bus for future visits to the valley.\u00a0 They offer senior adult discounts and even have a three trips for the price of two special.\u00a0 Also, there&#8217;s no park admission fee for those on the bus!<\/p>\n<p>No review of Yosemite Lakes Thousand Trails is complete without mention of Highway 120&#8217;s New Priest Grade.\u00a0 This 7-8 miles of road is a non-stop 5-6%, switchback filled challenge that must be faced to come to the campground.\u00a0\u00a0 The uphill side is also the side with the dropoffs.\u00a0 It will test the vehicle&#8217;s engine and the driver&#8217;s nerves.\u00a0 The downhill side hugs the side of the hill and it will test the vehicle&#8217;s transmission and brakes and the driver&#8217;s skills.\u00a0 There are two other nearby roads.\u00a0 One is the shorter and much steeper (15%) Old Priest &#8211; no one with a RV has any business on it and law enforcement agrees &#8211; RVs are banned from driving it.\u00a0 There&#8217;s another route that includes Greely Hill road.\u00a0 We checked it out and I decided it was better to just stay with New Priest.\u00a0 Here&#8217;s my take on it: if you are driving a RV that you know is underpowered or overweight or especially long you should think twice before tackling this section of road.\u00a0 However, most people with a properly set up RV and moderate driving experience can drive it.\u00a0 Hundreds of RVs, tour buses, and logging trucks do it every week.\u00a0 The YARTS bus drivers told me that their top of the hill speed target is 25 mph which they gear to hold down the grade.\u00a0 They also suggested that one keep an eye on oncoming traffic, making room for bigger vehicles, especially those coming downhill.\u00a0 On one had, this drive should be taken seriously.\u00a0 On the other hand, a lot of people do it with no problems whatsoever.\u00a0 We came up the grade about 25 mph and the engine was working hard.\u00a0 Our clutch fan came on early and stayed on all the way up and a ways beyond.\u00a0 We came down at 20-25 mph.\u00a0 I had to tap my brakes on some of the hairpins.\u00a0 Really, I thought coming down was easier than coming up.<\/p>\n<p>The reward is a nice campground near a beautiful National Park.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTRfDXW1jDe3FHkoXpMbHHG0SuhKlOb7DARJgjzSE3y0MOM76LtJlX_ulN9CQ2CLLtAjaIfVIx8r-VU\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Usually we use our 4G hotspot for the internet but that&#8217;s a complete no-go at this campground.\u00a0 Using our Wilson Sleek cradle I could get 1 or 2 bars of unreliable 3G &#8211;
