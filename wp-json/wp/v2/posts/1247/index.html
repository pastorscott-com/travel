My idea is to fully power the camper so we can have a\/c for sleeping.  Otherwise, we are in for some warm, humid, and noisy sleeping conditions.  I don&#8217;t know if this is a future strategy or not, but many people we know already have power restored so their generators are once again unused.  I made two phone calls and ended up with offers of two generators!  The one I ended up with is a beautiful 5kw Huffy power plant.  This one would actually power our entire house, but I&#8217;m going for the easy approach for now and am just powering the camper plus whatever we want plugged in inside.  It should take less than five gallons of fuel for a night, which is the capacity of the generator.  Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get a good night&#8217;s sleep tonight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/photos\/101128941131953400860\/albums\/5246367878190115185\">Lots of photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With temps rising to the mid to upper 80&#8217;s and no power company repair crews in sight I decided to see if I could track down a bigger generator.
