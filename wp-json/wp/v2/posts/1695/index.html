There are water spigots scattered around the campground so it\u2019s easy enough to fill up with fresh water upon arriving.  However, there is only one dump station for the entire campground.  After the busy weekend there was a line of people waiting their turn at the dump station.  The campground boasts a couple of new shower houses and restrooms.  I had a clear sky for satellite TV and my Verizon phone got a weak, but working 4G connect.  There\u2019s a fairly busy train track not far from the campground.  We often heard the trains but it wasn\u2019t a big deal.<\/p>\n<p>If you happen to be traveling I35 through northern Iowa and don\u2019t mind driving 10 miles or so off the freeway you might want to keep this place in mind.  I suggest you make a reservation so you can guarantee a parameter, back in spot unless you think you would be satisfied with a parallel parking site that will feel like a pull-through when there are few fellow campers around.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRlrIuo_NdBFEE0Y5nUT2oKHo7Ctj6DXHb4RyStxokIWIZKTSdp52jfHKm9T_QBVMV0Bf0qiC9aqKqy\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You might want to know that all the RV sites are 50\/30 amp only with no water or sewer hookups.
