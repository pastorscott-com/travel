This was followed by a couple of stays near Jackie&#8217;s family in Iowa.\u00a0 Then in the fall, my sister Susan joined us and traveled with us for a couple of weeks.\u00a0 These family times are a real bonus and make traveling even more fun.\u00a0 Same lesson: it\u2019s a real bonus being with family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>We always enjoy worshiping with the various congregations we visit in our travels.\u00a0 This year we especially enjoyed the Church of the Nazarene in Summerdale, AL.\u00a0 Being that this was one of our longer stays we got to know the folks a bit rather than just being one or two Sunday visitors.\u00a0 Then, we finished the year by filling in for a month for a pastor friend of ours in Denison, TX and then accepting an interim assignment (still ongoing) at Baytown, TX.\u00a0 A good lesson is that while being a perpetual church visitor is always interesting, nothing takes the place of being part of a worshiping community.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft \" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-JoJN0NkbdHk\/WSRmQUHICwI\/AAAAAAAAr_Q\/aNIMGB_P6DIQoI36ODsMh7-oKuwJUyb8wCCoYBhgL\/s0\/20170511_122726.jpg\" width=\"309\" height=\"232\" \/>During 2017 we towed the camper nearly 5000 miles, visited 17 states, and stayed in 34 different places.\u00a0 This year, when we arrived in South Dakota we completed visiting all 50 states (although not all in the RV).\u00a0 We started and finished the year volunteering on Battleship Texas.\u00a0 This marks our fourth season of wintering in this unique location on the Houston Ship Channel.\u00a0\u00a0 We are still working on our 2018 Adventure and expect to continue our journeys in this New Year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our 2017 Adventure had both ups and downs.\u00a0 It was a year with several unexpected expenses that included a broken windshield and various camper repair projects.\u00a0 Later on we decided it was time to put new tires on the camper.\u00a0 At four and a half years they still looked good but camper tires are notorious [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[49,50,101,108,110,113,120,140],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2647"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2647"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2647\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2647"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2647"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2647"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
