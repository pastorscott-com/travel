There\u2019s a big area of permanent\/leased sites, a KOA only campground, and a couple of sections that are shared by seasonal campers and transient users. I think the preferred Thousand Trails area is Phase 4 with paved roads, level gravel sites, and 50 amp\/full hookup sites. Several of them are pull through. The roads in Phase 2 aren\u2019t as good and not all sites have sewer hookups. The sewer hookups Phase 2 does have are interesting. There are \u201cmini septic tanks\u201d between every other site. Apparently, they work fine and allow RVs to be connected and used in a normal way.<\/p>\n<p>The property features a large pool, playground, mini-golf, and other recreational facilities.  An adjacent golf course is on the same property.   Our stay was near the end of the season so the pool was closed and there were no activities in the campground.  However, we enjoyed mild weather and the early stages of beautiful fall colors.  Also, there were fall fairs in the area and we enjoyed going to a couple of them.  <\/p>\n<p>We had good Verizon 4G and no problems getting satellite TV. We\u2019ve visited several Thousand Trails preserves through the past few years and we\u2019d rank this one as one of the nicer ones.  <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vS5b-WYazq5p0a8kIBcNQBODczj0nYz8O3Z4RBXi0qQo4FJB9_L-0qW8eaJaO5ivTQDvlU8iuAreO0n\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Indian Lakes Thousand Trails is a large southeastern Indiana campground at Batesville.
