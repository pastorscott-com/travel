Close to the Davenport, IA I280 bypass, on a pretty lake, and in a beautiful park. The campsites at West Lake Park Terrace Campground are full hookup, level sites, with gravel pads and concrete patios and lots of nice shade.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things you\u2019ll want to know. The water spigots are a distance back from the sites, and two sites share the same spigot, each of which has two hookups. You\u2019ll likely need some extra water hose. Also many of the sewer hookups are at the back of the site so you may need extra sewer hose or at at least pay attention when selecting a site. Also, there are several gates to West Lake Park. If you want Terrace Campground, you want Gate 5.<\/p>\n<p>This is a no reservations campground.  When you arrive you find a site and then go to the office to register and pay.  We arrived on an early Monday afternoon and had many sites to select from.  By Thursday most sites had been taken but there was still a selection of sites.  My guess is that the place pretty much fills up on summer weekends.<\/p>\n<p>Nearby is the water\/electric only campground, West Lake Park Summit Campground.  You actually register at the office at Gate 5 for that campground as well.<\/p>\n<p>This is a really nice campground and the prices are reasonably low.  We&#8217;ll remember this one for future stays.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRL4MOXM2n3P78Dm8aDnOVYfEANcMJpQpP8RgPDOFOiEAwngSdpRJPyVvfCRkqEAwK2SoD93IpIo7-t\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This park is a real gem.
