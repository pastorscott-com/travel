Still, the only way to beat it is to press on, and press on we did!<\/p>\n<p>The only biggie on the agenda for the day is a visit to Tower of London.&nbsp; The construction began there&nbsp; before 1100 when William the Conqueror built a tower on the river Thames as a defense against invaders.&nbsp; Now, it draws millions of visitors each year.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s famous for, I think, three things.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2011-London-9-28-2011-7-52-28-AM.jpg\" style=\"clear: right;

The Beefeaters lead tours and serve, in general, as congenial hosts.&nbsp; These are all retired military men who take their jobs as historians and protectors of this place quite seriously.&nbsp; Their tours are fun and informative.&nbsp; When some ladies ignored the warnings to not take photos in one building, the gentleman stopped them and then made them erase the photos to his satisfaction before they could go on.&nbsp; <br \/>We enjoyed several floors of displays in the armory.&nbsp; There\u2019s armor worn by kings, weapons, and lots of other really neat things to see.<\/p>\n<p>The second big deal is that the British Crown jewels are on display here.&nbsp; I\u2019ve never seen so much gold and diamonds and other precious stones in my life.&nbsp; Of course, that\u2019s one of the \u201cno pictures\u201d parts of the place.&nbsp; In fact, to view the crown jewels, you stand on an escalator sort of deal that moves you along.&nbsp; You can go back and ride as many times as you wish, but you can\u2019t stop in front of any of the main displays.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are other amazing things you can stand and see \u2013 almost beyond description.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2011-London-9-28-2011-7-58-59-AM.jpg\" style=\"clear: left;

<\/p>\n<p>In the face of how some were mistreated at the Tower I shouldn\u2019t complain too much about how leg weary Jackie and I became during our hours there.&nbsp; Up and down stairs, standing, walking \u2013 by mid-afternoon our legs were starting to call the shots!&nbsp; It was time to head \u201chome\u201d for a break.&nbsp; We found our way to the light rail and made our way back to nearby Canary Wharf.&nbsp; Maybe by early evening we\u2019ll have enough energy to go to a nearby restaurant for a nice supper!<\/p>\n<p>You can see lots of photos from our trip on <a href=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/101128941131953400860\/2011LondonTrip#\">my photo album.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tuesday night\u2019s sleep wasn\u2019t as good as we hoped for.&nbsp;
