Our day in the Peak District took us out into that area, known as the Peak District \u2013 home to deep valleys, flowing streams, steep green hills, and pretty towns and villages.  We used Rabbie&#8217;s Tours for this trip and we do recommend them.<\/p>\n<p>The drive out of Manchester into the heart of this beautiful area is just over an hour but the change from big city to rural beauty is dramatic.  We stopped in two towns where we had plenty of time to look around.<\/p>\n<p>The first was Castleton. The ruins of a medieval fortress, Pervil Castle, overlooks the village.  Some climb up the hill to enjoy the panoramic views.  We opted to wander around town and take photos.  <\/p>\n<p>We went to the town of Bakewell for a longer break where we had a nice lunch.  The River Wye flows through the village (interestingly, &#8220;Wye&#8221; means &#8220;River&#8221; so it is actually &#8220;River-River&#8221;).  The railings of one footbridge is jam packed with &#8220;love locks.&#8221;  Couples get padlocks and put their names on them.  They attach them to the bridge rail and then toss the keys away.  Bakewell is also known for a particular jam and almond pudding called, appropriately enough, &#8220;Bakewell Pudding.&#8221;  There is a sort of copyright on it, and only in this village can it be called &#8220;Bakewell Pudding.&#8221;  Of course, we had to try some with our lunch and it was quite good!<\/p>\n<p>The scenery was wonderful.  One interesting stop was the overlook above the Monsal Head Viaduct.  This was built as a railroad bridge but when the rail line was taken out of service the line was turned into a hiking trail that is very popular.  Our stop there was just for photos so we didn&#8217;t get to walk any of the trail, but we did enjoy seeing the viaduct far below.<\/p>\n<p>Our other major attraction of the day was Poole Cavern.  We&#8217;ve been in bigger caves but this one has a lot to offer.  Our cave tour guide was knowledgeable and interesting and we learned about the caverns and the infamous Mr. Poole who used the cave as a hideout in the 15th century.  <\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re glad we took this tour as it gave us an opportunity to see an area near Manchester that we haven&#8217;t had opportunity to explore.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From certain places around Manchester you can look to the southeast and see big hills off in the distance.
