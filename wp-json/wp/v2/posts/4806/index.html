One result of that was our spending a month at Old River Road RV Resort in Kerrville.  This is a large, newer park a few miles outside of Kerrville.  The primary feature of the park is that the Guadalupe River borders the property.  The clear, flowing river is a playground for tubing and fishing.  I enjoyed many quiet walks on the bank of the river.  Just adjacent to the campground portion of the river is a swimming spot that is popular with the locals.  Golf cart rentals are popular here, mostly, I think, because of the steep hill going down to the river.  I know that walking up and down it added considerably to my morning workout!<\/p>\n<p>The campground has a large section of permanent RV&#8217;s.  There are also rental cabins that get considerable use.  We were given a spot more or less off to ourselves.  We didn&#8217;t mind that a bit.  There are different levels of campsites.  The most expensive are wide and paved, generally with a view of the river down below.  The other sites are rock but plenty long enough for any RV.  Most are pull-through.  The section we were in had a slight slope down toward the River.  This wouldn&#8217;t be as noticeable with a smaller motorhome or travel trailer.  It was more obvious in our longer rig and we ended up with the front tires up in the air about eight inches.  I put leveling blocks under the tires and brought out an extra step that was still not quite tall enough.  It wasn&#8217;t a real big deal, but in the future I think we&#8217;d lobby for a spot in an area that didn&#8217;t have the slope.<\/p>\n<p>If playing in the River doesn&#8217;t sound good, there are two pools, one inside.  We liked the inside one because it has a heated spa attached to it.  It was a relaxing and refreshing place.  The outside pool also has a kid&#8217;s water park.  There are also a couple of nice playgrounds for the children and two doggie parks for the pets.  <\/p>\n<p>The campground has a small store and also a larger Activity center that has game and workout rooms.  There are also two laundries. <\/p>\n<p>Since our stay was during the summer it was hot and our two air conditioners ran a lot.  There are young trees, but they aren&#8217;t big enough to offer any significant shade.  <\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed sitting out at night after things had cooled down.  The sky was filled with stars \u2013 we could even see the Milky Way many nights.  We counted satellites gliding over and saw a few meteors.  <\/p>\n<p>Campground WiFi was pretty good, although we felt our Jetpack was a bit faster.  With the lack of trees I had no big issues getting satellite.<\/p>\n<p>The Hill Country is a beautiful and interesting area.  We visited the Coming King Sculpture Garden, nearby Fredericksburg, Stonehenge II, and did a longer drive into the bigger &#8220;hills&#8221; (I think they would be called &#8220;mountains&#8221; in some parts of the country) to the west of the area.  We really liked the old fashioned burgers at Classics Burgers.  Also, the fried catfish at Lakehouse restaurant was very good.  We&#8217;ve enjoyed this area for years and this stay was a good one.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRG0XxydGrgV6OkJH0lXdpMIQcN23gnXcC8Nn4B4LX-jV6ZOohQ-RAVsvIiI5lQHHWXQiD3_OfXt-bP\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our big travel plans for our 2021 Adventure had to be set aside, so we decided to at least head for the Texas Hill Country to get away from the humidity of the Texas Gulf coast.
