They are able to land in some of the more popular spots on busy weekends.\u00a0 Such travel is generally easier on the expense sheet; not only because you aren&#8217;t at the mercy of the campground owner who has the last available spot in the area but also because you tend to travel point to point rather than wandering between undetermined destinations.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on vacation, you most likely want to be a planner.\u00a0 No one wants to waste precious vacation camping nights parked at a truck stop.\u00a0 I think fulltimers are more likely to be planners, although there are a lot of fulltime freelancers out there.\u00a0 Even then, though, most fulltimers make reservations for holidays, planning to arrive early and then stay on a day or two after all the poor weekenders have to return to the daily grind. \u00a0\u00a0Even fulltimers who do a lot of freelancing tend to set a few hard dates and then freelance between them.<\/p>\n<p>Fulltimers, more than most people, tend to march to the beat of their own drummer so there&#8217;s lots of wiggle room on this one. \u00a0Really, there&#8217;s no right or wrong way to do it &#8211; just &#8220;your way.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Planner or freelancer, which will it be?\u00a0 That&#8217;s a question I come across fairly often, and I&#8217;ve written about it here and also here.\u00a0 Should a fulltimer create a travel calendar, make reservations, and follow a schedule?\u00a0 Or should a fulltimer go with the flow, setting sail in the morning, not worrying about where they [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[4,22,49,50,101,108],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2086"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2086"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2086\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4441,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2086\/revisions\/4441"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2086"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2086"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2086"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
