It is just a minute or two off of I 44, a handy place for travelers who just want a FHU spot for the night before continuing their trip on the Interstate.  There&#8217;s a store with restaurant, a pool, and a doggie park.  Also, Meramec Caverns is nearby.  The camp area is &#8220;T&#8221; shaped with the main section being a row of pull through sites set up for bigger rigs.  The other section is set up for smaller rigs or tents.  Also there are several rental cabins scattered around.  <\/p>\n<p>As I said, this isn&#8217;t a destination campground.  On one hand I&#8217;d say it serves it&#8217;s purpose.  However, there are a few negatives.  First, the campground is, in my opinion, overpriced for what you get.  Second, the sites are very close together side to side.  Third, the sites have a slight slope front to back, making it hard to level a motorhome like ours.  <\/p>\n<p>We had a good Verizon signal and no problem getting satellite TV.<\/p>\n<p>Having said all that, for this trip, this KOA was in the right spot for us to break up a longer move.  Had it not been for that we would have stayed elsewhere, but being so close to the interstate and at the half-way point for this relocation this campground suited our needs just fine.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vS7_nPqywapHrJyMZn3RiC1fTaL-tmERuN0kgZiSEROnZbaJjOUCNXcK0VEsb4f06tvIyBrjzZxm5pc\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Stanton-Meramec KOA in Stanton, MO makes no claims of being a destination campground.
