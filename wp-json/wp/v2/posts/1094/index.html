After buying our tickets we looked a the displays and watched a video about mining. When they called our tour we lined up and were given hard hats, slickers, and miners headlamps. We then went out and got on a small tram that took us down into the mine. Two guides gave us a great tour telling us how the mine was laid out and what it was like to be the miner. They demonstrated the tools they used and talked about the dangers they faced. At two places we got off the tram and walked down the tunnels to see what it would have looked like to the miners. It was both educational and fun and we highly recommend not only the mine tour, downtown Bisbee which is a unique experience in itself.<\/p>\n<p>We know we hardly scratched the surface of interesting things to see and do in this area. On future trips we&#8217;ll check out the &#8220;Cochise Circle&#8221; of historic places related to the great Indian Chief, Wonderland of the Rocks at Chiricahua National Monument, and so much more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We enjoyed our time in Southeastern Arizona.
