The campground is located on the northwest side of Waco on Lake Waco. There are many campsites with great lake views. We were in the middle loop. Only three of the campsites in our loop have full hookups. All three FHU sites are on the side of the road away from the lake. We still had great views but there were campers in pull through sites (but no sewer) between us and the lake. I think the loop most distant from the entry has more FHU spots. On future visits we will probably try for one of those sites (but see the information on the airport below).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2015\/05\/20\/campground-review-airport-park-coe-waco-tx\/\">A previous review is here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Still, though, we had little to complain about. Our view out the front window was very nice, the site was paved and easy access, and we enjoyed having FHUs. Most of the sites slope a bit toward the water. Because of that I noticed that the motorhomes especially that had back in sites with the rear of the camper toward the water had a harder time getting level &#8211; something to keep in mind when making reservations.<\/p>\n<p>And, if you are coming over the weekend, you will want to make a reservation. This popular campground fills up often.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that this is called &#8220;Airport park&#8221; might help serve notice that the campground is adjacent a busy airport. Everything from recreational small planes to passenger jets to military aircraft come and go. During our visit a major fall cold front came in (record lows in the 20&#8217;s matter of fact). With a north wind, the air traffic came and went right over the campground and lake. Our middle campground was a bit west of the primary traffic &#8211; that most distant campground I mentioned was directly under it. After a few days the wind shifted and so did the air traffic. There was still some action, but not nearly as much.<\/p>\n<p>Waco is a neat city with lots to see and do. We visited Magnolia attractions, went to a big Christmas market and book sale, and walked across the famous Brazos river bridge in downtown. There is more to see, but this is not our first visit to Waco. With the cold, rainy weather throughout the first part of our visit we were mostly happy to hang out at the campground, staying inside, enjoying the view.<\/p>\n<p>This is a great campground and we recommend it to you.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSpJ-k0huArp9x0Y3gQgGyxISCmLmG3ElAOnsC3ld-GGCeXn5pWDPUaaHhHhLyKNE-RCuGbb-il2dES\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I have said before, Corps of Engineers campgrounds are our favorites and we have enjoyed Airport Park CoE again this stay.
