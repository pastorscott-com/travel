With the short summer camping season in the area we understood that paying a premium (for us) price was acceptable.  We did wish there was some level of discount for a weekly stay; or maybe some membership discounts \u2013 but alas, there were none.  This is a popular summer place so I recommend you make reservations if you plan on staying over a weekend.<\/p>\n<p>On future visits I think I\u2019d pick either one of the end spots, giving us a bit of room out the front door, or maybe one of the electric only grassy spots which are much roomier.  Not only would a grassy spot give us some elbow room, but since they offer only partial hookups, they cost a bit less too!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRP5XWWvEOTp3Uc9dM8ecb-BZCqwQXaTpAqn5egiCuw-nrycD2HqTSEfsFawXwwrkZ5HIqxWntwYt3U\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our neighbors were very close by but folks were generally friendly and just wanting to enjoy the cool Michigan Upper Peninsula summer weather.
