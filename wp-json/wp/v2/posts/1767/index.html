With the short summer camping season in the area we understood that paying a premium (for us) price was acceptable.

This is a popular summer place so I recommend you make reservations if you plan on staying over a weekend.<\/p>\n<p>On future visits I think I\u2019d pick either one of the end spots, giving us a bit of room out the front door, or maybe one of the electric only grassy spots which are much roomier. Not only would a grassy spot give us some elbow room, but since they offer only partial hookups, they cost a bit less too!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Our neighbors were very close by but folks were generally friendly and just wanting to enjoy the cool Michigan Upper Peninsula summer weather.
