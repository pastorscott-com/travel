The train trip, including the journey from our flat to the train station, is about 2 hours. York, which was founded in 71 A.D. has Roman walls, a huge and famous church, an ancient and still-operating shopping district, a castle, and is the home of the National Rail Museum. Honestly, there&#8217;s more than anyone can hope to see in one day.<\/p>\n<p>This time of the year, famous Shambles Street is the epicenter of a huge Christmas market. We checked out the wall, which is easily reached from the rail station and then headed to the Christmas market. Our plan was to look it over and then visit York Minister \u2013 the world-famous church.<\/p>\n<p>Our plans didn&#8217;t work out because the Christmas Market was absolutely amazing. Every time we thought we were coming to the end of the market we would look down a street and see another street filled with stalls of food and gifts.<\/p>\n<p>By the time we finished, we were running out of energy and time. We may well return to York in a few months just to see some of the above-mentioned sights. At least we have a better idea of what to expect on a future adventure there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>York, England is about 70 miles from where we are staying in southern Manchester.
