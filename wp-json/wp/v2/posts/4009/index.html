As we planned our trip through this area again a return visit was on our &#8220;must-do&#8221; list.  We had a great day for this visit and it is just as beautiful as I remember. We opted to purchase tickets to take the park shuttle to the top of the trail, making the mile and a half hike through the gorge almost all downhill.  We saw many people hiking up and were glad we were taking the route of least resistance!  The trail is made up of stairs and winding pathways along the river with many waterfalls along the way. The bridges and safety walls are well kept but the pathway is narrow in some places. There are beautiful stone arch bridges and in a couple of places the trail takes you under waterfalls.  We were able to find a wider spot where we could sit on the wall and enjoy a picnic lunch in as beautiful a setting as you&#8217;ve ever seen. The high rock walls and overhanging trees add to the beauty of it.  We think this NY York State Park is a world class attraction and apparently many agree as we heard a wide variety of languages being spoken by our fellow hikers.<br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTeWpKfYraXKPYB7VhowpDW0awSGUpvjMm6EUTYp31qDCI-YBu58fsNxEOcQCcKtsI4eYIuHHaRZt1I\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we last visited Watkins Glen, NY State Park we were blown away by its beauty.
