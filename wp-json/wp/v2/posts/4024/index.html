This campground is out of the primary tourism area but just barely, making it a quiet alternative if you are willing to drive 30 minutes or so to the Falls. Old Fort Niagara is just 10 miles away. Just down the road to the east is a nice state park and then the Wilson Marina.<\/p>\n<p>Daisy Barn is a smaller campground with mostly long timers, many paying an annual fee and leaving their camper on their site even as they head south for the winter. The folks we met were friendly and used to travelers like us passing through their neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed the campground WiFi and had no problem getting satellite TV. My Verizon signal was about 2 bars and usable but not great.  Daisy Barn Campground is the turn around point in our 2019 Adventure.  Up to this point our moves have been in the east-north direction.  From this point on they are in the west-south direction.<\/p>\n<p>Most evenings people gather at the pavilion that overlooks the Lake to enjoy the spectacular sunsets. Honestly, that view is our favorite thing about Daisy Barn.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vS3cy6mWA2kZmnbmHMGIAkT-z2LAU0PJEgOlZX-D4ExI6r6gEmsivzRlNRrAs_hRhanCC5VElAi8Ory\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Daisy Barn Campground is located near Wilson, NY, right on Lake Ontario and not far from Niagara Falls.
