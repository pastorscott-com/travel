This destination boasts 79 acres of floral beauty \u2013 over 7 million tulips (I confess that I didn&#8217;t count them!) plus many other beautiful plants.  Keukenhof is only open to the public about 50 days each Spring when the Tulips are in bloom.  We stayed in a hotel near the airport to take advantage of the express bus that is available from there.  Honestly, the &#8220;airport&#8221; pickup point is a bit of a hike from all the other bus\/train\/air hubs.  Starting the day off with a hike isn&#8217;t the best approach when you are going to stroll the wonderful garden paths for a few hours!  We took multiple breaks, including having lunch at one of the cafes.  The Gardens were very crowded, but we still found spots where we could stop and enjoy the amazing beauty.  There are wonderful fields of tulips all around the Gardens with ample overlooks for great photos.  We very much enjoyed our &#8220;tiptoe through the tulips&#8221; at Keukenhof and highly recommend it to you.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The primary purpose of our trip to Amsterdam was to visit the world-famous Keukenhof Gardens.
