The answer is actually pretty easy: if you had a washer\/dryer in your house you\u2019ll probably want one in your RV. If you enjoyed going to a laundromat before, you\u2019ll probably want to keep going to one. Admittedly, this approach has its limits \u2013 for instance, while dish washers are available, they aren\u2019t all that common so you might have to surrender to dish washing in the RV even though you always used a dish washer in your old life.<\/p>\n<p>Without doubt, living as a fulltimer means that some things will be more challenging than they were in your pre-fulltiming days. There will be times when you won\u2019t be able to get the satellite signal or when you are camping without a sewer connect, thus limiting your use of the on-board washer. It\u2019s all part of the adventure and you will have to find ways to accommodate such things.<\/p>\n<p>Still, though, thinking that one is going fulltime and that once you are \u201cout there\u201d that everything will be different is probably mistaken. Lots of things will be different \u2013 hopefully, in great ways. However, you will still be the same person who wants oatmeal for breakfast most mornings, wants to do your laundry \u201cat home,\u201d and wants to watch the evening news on TV. Knowing this will help you make decisions about stuff like whether or not to sign up for a big data cell plan or buy a combo washer\/dryer or get a fancy satellite setup.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It goes without saying that moving to fulltiming from a traditional \u201cstix and brix\u201d life is a major transition.
