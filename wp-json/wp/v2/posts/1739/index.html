It was in full swing so we decided to check it out.  We got there in midafternoon and walked through the animal exhibits and then the exhibit hall where there was a variety of food, art, woodworking, flowers, farm, and garden products as well as handmade clothing and quits. We walked through the carnival and then settled in in the grandstands. Prior to the main event of the day was a children\u2019s peddle powered tractor pull complete with peddle tractors and a mini-moving weight.  The kids peddled with all their might as the weight got heavier and heavier.  It was cute and fun to watch as parents happily clicked photos of the event.  The tractor pull, itself, was quite entertaining as various classes of pullers took their turns.  We saw everything from antique tractors to pickup trucks to souped-up modern day tractors pull a big weight sled that is engineered to get heavier the farther it is moved.  It was my first time to see anything like this and I found it a fun and entertaining way spend an evening in Wisconsin.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSqJxxUn9C80R0BiJ78jmxf7iKijoBvSDS1CF3Te3pldwJ25a-rP9cmAPImyRjDj28w8lS5eDi47A2I\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In comparison, the Adams County Fair at Friendship, WI was pure hometown fun.
