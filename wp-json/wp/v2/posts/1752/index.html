It\u2019s around 30 minutes north of Green Bay and was a good spot for us, giving us easy access to Green Bay but in a preferable small town setting. The campground is, I\u2019d guess, around 60% seasonal sites and I was told that there\u2019s a waiting list for those sites. Around the parameter, and right on Oconto River, is where most of the short term sites are. They are grass sites and set up so two RV\u2019s share a common electric pedestal, with one rig facing the river and the other facing the road. This, though, isn\u2019t always the case, as several sites are set up for \u201cparallel parking\u201d between the river and the road. The majority of the sites are full hook up with 50 amps although there are sections of the campground devoted to tent camping.<\/p>\n<p>The river is a popular kayak\/tubing spot and people also catch a variety of fish. Canoes, tubes, etc. are available for rent and firewood is for sale at the camp office. The city pool and ball fields plus a disc golf course is nearby.<\/p>\n<p>Our site was situated in an interesting spot. We were right on the river, a pretty spot. However, just across the river is a Kwik-Trip convenience store, a mini-golf course, McDonalds, and auto parts store. However, to get to these, and other stores, at least without a boat, we had to drive out of the campground and around it through town, following the river. The driving distance was over a mile and a half. There\u2019s talk about adding a foot bridge, which would be convenient. However, many of the seasonal residents are concerned with the amount of non-camping foot traffic through the campground that would result.<\/p>\n<p>The campground recommends reservations, and I\u2019m sure they are needed on summer weekends as many folks from Green Bay come for a quick get-away. We had good 4G Verizon and got two of our three Dish Network satellites. I think it would be easy enough to get all the satellites in some sites and downright impossible to get any of them in others. All in all, we really like this campground and will likely return on future trips into and through northeast Wisconsin.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Holtwood Campground in Oconto, WI is a popular seasonal campground with several sites for short term stays as well.
