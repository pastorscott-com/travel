It is a privately owned cave that is well cared for with many &#8220;living&#8221; features.  The tour took about 45 minutes and was just right for a cool (56 degree) break after over 3 hours on the river.<\/p>\n<p>For evening fun we went to the small town of South West, MO which is on the MO, KS, OK state lines.  This town has a population of 600 but tonight they had a great Independence Day concert and cookout.  There were several thousand people there to enjoy free watermelon and free music from the Chuck Wagon Gang &#8211; then fireworks after dark.  We were pretty tired by the &#8220;half time&#8221; of the concert so we headed back to our motel in Neosho for the night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had a wonderful time canoeing along Elk River in southwest Missouri today.
