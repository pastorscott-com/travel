This is agricultural country, filled with corn and soybean fields; farmed by Amish and \u201cEnglish\u201d alike. The campground is a big one with lots of leased sites plus plenty of room for travelers, rallies, etc. Most all the sites are on grass and many are \u201crally field\u201d types of sites with full hookups. Most of the sites are level. We managed to get a spot in the trees rather than the field and with the big trees came roots and with the roots an un-level, sloping spot. In our case, we didn\u2019t mind that because we had a new leveling system to try out. It worked great. Had we arrived prior to the camper upgrade I would have likely asked for a different spot. Generally, with campers scattered around the place feels roomy. Over this mid-June weekend, though, the place filled up and we had people at close quarters all around us. That was no big deal to us, but we were glad to get a bit of breathing space back on Sunday afternoon when all the poor working people had to go home to reality. The campground has pretty decent WiFi that worked fine for us until the weekend when it was overloaded. Even the local cell tower was impacted and I had a usable but slower data stream. For some reason the slowdown continued on Monday. The shower rooms\/bathrooms in our area were usable but very dated. I\u2019m not sure about others. The property has a swimming pond that got lots of use by the kids. A new pool is being built and will be in use by next year or even sooner. The campground has a nice mini-golf and driving range available for an extra charge. Probably the biggest issue we had was that the water tasted metallic and stained our sink and commode.<\/p>\n<p>One reason for the full campground over our weekend here was a Civil War reenactment group.  They pitched tents and set up camps reflective of that era.  Their biggest draw was a couple of cannons.  Everyone enjoyed their demonstrations, especially the night fire on Saturday night.<\/p>\n<p>This is not only Amish country, but is also RV country.  The Numar factory and other RV industry related businesses are just a few minutes away in nearby Nappanee.  <\/p>\n<p>We liked Pla-Mor and would return for a future visit.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRs_rh2vLEXyz0vYetXGjxjkS9EJaSgaAEtYMBgmA8HM3vmivvZrc7fuT8WktRNa8p2PV5wNggIIhKR\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pla-Mor Campground, Bremen, Indiana is just south of the South Bend\/Elkhart metro areas of northern Indiana.
