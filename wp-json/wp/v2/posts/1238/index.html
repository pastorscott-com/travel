Both have much to offer and even though we decided, ultimately, on the cruise we still intend to someday visit England, France, and other nearby European countries.<\/p>\n<p>Since we love scenery and since we\u2019ve never been on a cruise we decided on Alaska. You\u2019d think that making that decision would settle things but that is far from true. There are many details because there are several cruise lines that sail Alaska and those cruises depart from Seattle, Vancouver, and Seward. Some are one way and others are round trip. Most are seven days. However, it\u2019s possible to go up to eleven days or more. If you want, you can book directly through the cruise line or let a travel agent handle it all. There are airline tickets, motel reservations, transfers, and hundreds of excursions from which to choose.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>The cruise decision also involves deciding which ports one wishes to visit. We decided to round trip from Seattle on Royal Caribbean. For one thing, their prices were just a bit lower than others. For another, RCI also sails out of Galveston to Mexico and the Caribbean. Once you cruise on a line they offer discounts on future sailings. My thinking was that just in case I go crazy for cruising and want to do it again, it would be to my advantage to use a line that cruises out of nearby Galveston.<\/p>\n<p>Another decision to make is how much money to spend on a cabin. The cabins on the cruise I picked varied in price from $500 a person to $5000 a person. You can easily guess the differences. Jackie and I could have afforded a windowed cabin but we opted to go with the less expensive, inside cabin. Aside from the financial considerations is the fact that a lot of the major sightseeing takes place while in port anyway. Also, on the ship are an amazing number of public places with comfortable seating and panoramic views. Only the millionaire suites come close to having the views available from any of dozens of armchair spots located throughout the ship.<\/p>\n<p>So, we went with the Rhapsody of the Seas round trip from Seattle to the Alaskan inside passage that set sail on August 14, 2009.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 1: Sail Day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Luggage and cruise documents in hand we arrived at Seattle&#8217;s Pier 91.\u00a0 Friends from the Seattle area hosted us for a few days and then were kind enough to drop us off at the pier.\u00a0 As soon as the vehicle stopped a porter asked us if we were on Rhapsody of the Seas.\u00a0 When we said we were he said he&#8217;d be glad to take care of our baggage for us.\u00a0 Since our booking was all electronic, we didn&#8217;t have official luggage tags that some people have.\u00a0 The porter led us to a counter where a man asked our names and then handed our porter tags.\u00a0 We stood there while he put them on and then he told us that was it.\u00a0 The bags would be delivered to our room.\u00a0 I handed him a tip and we went inside where a smiling lady looked at our documentation and pointed us to security.<\/p>\n<p>Passing through security was a lot like going through security at an airport.\u00a0 However, unlike it is at the airport, the people handing security were smiling and welcoming us.\u00a0 From there we stood in a long, but fast moving line for cruise check in.\u00a0 Within 10 minutes we were at a window where we showed our passports, cruise documents, and the credit card which was linked to our sail account.\u00a0 Then, with our sail passes in hand (these serve as our identification, room key, and on board credit card) we walked up several flights to board the ship on level five.\u00a0 Around 20 minutes from arriving at the pier we walked onto the ship.<\/p>\n<p>The rooms were already open so we found our way to our tiny room.\u00a0 Since we&#8217;d asked for a \u201cqueen size\u201d bed the room had been set up that way.\u00a0 The room was so small that you couldn&#8217;t walk around the bed, but had to climb on and off the end.\u00a0 Closet space was adequate in spite of the fact that our two big suitcases took up most of one side.\u00a0 The bathroom was tiny and the shower had only a curtain rather than a door.\u00a0 It is likely that the biggest advantage to having a higher class cabin isn&#8217;t the outside view so much as it is the amount of space.\u00a0 Still, there was plenty of drawer space.\u00a0 We unloaded our luggage and found spots for everything.<\/p>\n<p>We had eaten while waiting for the luggage to be delivered.\u00a0 The buffet restaurant is called the Windjammer and is located in the front of the ship on deck nine.\u00a0 Our first meal there wasn&#8217;t especially impressive; however, subsequent meals were just fine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2: At Sea<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Day two was spent out at sea, no land in sight.\u00a0 Going north RCI ships travel outside the inside passage.\u00a0 During the night ship movement increased, both up-down and side to side.\u00a0 The advice to get a cabin as close to the center of the ship as possible proved to be excellent advice as our little cabin and areas in the center of the ship felt more solid than, say the Windjammer at the front of the ship.\u00a0 The movement was larger than expected, but at least it was consistent.\u00a0 From past experience it is random movement while on a deep sea fishing boat just sitting in the water that made me sea sick.\u00a0 The movement of the ship was sometimes disorienting, but my stomach seemed to be okay with the predictable movement.<br \/>\nAll in all, Saturday was a lazy day.\u00a0 Jackie and I walked around the ship, finding more and more nice spots to sit and watch the ocean go by.\u00a0 For most of the day there was nothing to see but water with not a single other vessel in sight.\u00a0 We were told we were around 37 miles out.<\/p>\n<p>We had some success though.\u00a0 First, I spotted the spout of a whale.\u00a0 Then, in the afternoon we actually saw the back of a whale as it sounded.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, we explored the ship, ate some good fish and chips at the Windjammer, and I took a nice long nap!<\/p>\n<p>Jackie and I spent our anniversary in the luxury of our ocean journey with a quiet day at sea.\u00a0 Supper was eaten in the formal dining room.\u00a0 We asked for a table for two but with the tables so close together, we ended up feeling like we were at a group table again.\u00a0 The waiter, Raul, was very good and, with the tables so close, he often spoke to six of us at once.<\/p>\n<p>A fifty&#8217;s rock group was in the theatre after supper, but the place was full when we got there, so we found quiet spot and watched the world go by.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3: Juneau<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arrival in Juneau wasn&#8217;t till late morning, but overnight we had moved back toward land and by breakfast time there were tree covered mountainous islands on both sides of us.\u00a0 The feeling was something like taking a cruise through the Rocky Mountains!\u00a0 The day was hazy and cloudy but as we got closer to land we could see snow fields and waterfalls.<\/p>\n<p>We were happy to see that a worship service was scheduled and at 8:00 we made our way to the \u201cShall we Dance\u201d Lounge for church!\u00a0 Our speaker was none other than Joel Olsten of Houston Lakewood Church.\u00a0 However, I must hurry to add that it was on video.\u00a0 Around 30 of us remembered that it was the Lord&#8217;s Day and took time for a worship service.<\/p>\n<p>As we approached land the motion of the sea was replaced once again by the rumble strips we felt in Puget Sound.\u00a0 Also, the land on either side of the ship narrowed the waterway as we continued.\u00a0 It was exciting to near our first port, but the weather was discouraging.\u00a0 The rain and clouds and wind and 57 degrees reminded us that we were, indeed, on the coast of Alaska.<\/p>\n<p>Two other cruise ships were already in port and the remaining slot looked like it was an afterthought.\u00a0 The ship was brought about broadside into the wind and the captain worked for quite some time to bring the Rhapsody to that dock.\u00a0 However, the wind pushing against our 11+ story vessel won the battle.\u00a0 As we ate an early lunch the ship was backed away and announcements were made that an effort would be made in 45 minutes or so to dock the ship.\u00a0 When the ship&#8217;s side thrusters were used at full power the Windjammer vibrated to the point that we wondered if dishes would start breaking.<\/p>\n<p>An hour or so later we were finally docked.\u00a0 It was announced that those with RCI expeditions were to disembark first, based on their tour times.\u00a0 We \u201cindependent\u201d cruisers could ask for special dispensation to leave the ship, otherwise, the general ship population was to wait.\u00a0 So we waited 45 minutes or so to leave the ship.\u00a0 When our turn came, we paid $3 to be shuttled closer to town where the other ships were docked.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Jackie and I wanted to do something special for our 40th wedding anniversary and narrowed possible celebrations to trip to England or an Alaskan Cruise.
