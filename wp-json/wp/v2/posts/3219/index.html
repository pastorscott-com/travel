My best memories of this area are enjoying fish and chips at an area restaurant, eating some great ice cream, and taking a very nice (but congested) coastal drive to Kennebunkport. While there we enjoyed a few quiet moments at Saint Anne\u2019s By The Sea which is a historical Episcopal Church with a wonderful view of the ocean. Nearby we also saw the summer home of President G.H.W. Bush (from a distance, of course!). Honestly, although our campground was in town and only a few minutes from the beach the August traffic and parking issues made it a major effort to go anywhere. Even if we did find a parking spot that would accommodate our truck the charge for parking made it prohibitive for us.  There&#8217;s a local shuttle that can be ridden for a nominal cost of just $1 a ride, but it battles the same traffic.  The result for us was that we just hung around the campground a bit more where we could avoid the traffic in this very popular tourist area.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vT1HypjSP8tZdVPwsVN9SJJ7STwKkRuMQ0yCi1KRfwaLcYTKlkn6ZtCWQU-bq_Zl0fSWRV6gx_gbpKV\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/m4nymbAnfCwP7R5i6\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our final week in Maine on this year&#8217;s adventure brought us to the Wells-Kennebunkport area.
