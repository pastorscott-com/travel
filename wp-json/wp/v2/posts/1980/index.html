We spent the first months of the year there, helping out at both the Monument and on the Battleship Texas which is on the same property. In return for volunteering 25 hours a week we were given &#8220;free parking&#8221; there. We enjoyed the experience enough that we signed up for another stay in the new year. For us, this is a great win: it is interesting and fun, close to family and many friends, and a real money saver. We also enjoyed being part of the community of volunteers and staff. That&#8217;s not to say there are no negatives, but overall, it&#8217;s a positive experience.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see we had a good 2015 Adventure and, yes, we&#8217;re already working on the 2016 Adventure. We plan to head for the Rocky Mountains &#8211; Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and then across to the Black Hills of South Dakota!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We enjoyed our 2015 Adventure very much!
