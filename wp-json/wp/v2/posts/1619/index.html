If you have a problems with cedar you might want to think twice before coming during the time of the year when the trees are pollinating. This shouldn&#8217;t have been a problem for us this late into the spring but I think the storms stirred things up and both of us began having sinus problems after a few days.<\/p>\n<p>The nice town of Whitney is just down the road and there are plenty of fast food places, a grocery store, and an old downtown that is showing some life.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the tornado of Mother&#8217;s Day this area has been pounded by big storms for several weeks now. We happily missed the tornado, but had two severe thunderstorm warnings during our one week stay. We understand that is not the fault of the campground but the potential of more severe weather pretty much deflated the camping experience here for us.<\/p>\n<p>I was told by management that the tornado has spurred several big projects for the campground. In addition to insurance money, more money is coming in to upgrade much of the campground. I hope that some of that goes into leveling the campsites, fixing the roads, and upgrading the electric so there are more 50 amp sites. I&#8217;ll look forward to making a return visit and seeing all that has been done &#8211; and, I certainly hope, enjoying the campground without having to keep such a close eye on the weather.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos More on the trees: the campground is in a forest of cedar.
