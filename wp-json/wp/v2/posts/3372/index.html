We towed the 5th wheel over 5100 miles, visiting 34 campgrounds in 17 states. Our average travel day was 150 miles and our average stay was about 11 days (although that is skewed a bit because of two longer winter stops).<\/p>\n<p>We had lots of opportunities to enjoy our upgraded <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/thousand-trails\/\">Thousand Trails<\/a> membership, spending 120 nights at their properties. Our membership saves us a lot of money and much of my <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/planning\/\">travel planning<\/a> consists of stitching together a route that includes these campgrounds.<\/p>\n<p>We also stayed 45 nights in <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/army-corps-of-engineers\/\">Corps of Engineers<\/a> campgrounds. These are our favorite campgrounds: almost always well laid out, spacious, and in beautiful locations. With our America the Beautiful pass we average paying $11-12 per night. Really, the CoE campgrounds spoil us for staying in tighter, urban campgrounds. If there is any negative at all it is that these campgrounds often offer only water and electric hookups and are generally rather out of the way, off the beaten track.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, we like alternating our stays between campgrounds right in the middle of the action and quieter, more laid-back spots. That approach was really evident during our two weeks at Acadia National Park in Maine. The first week we were in a <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018\/08\/05\/2018-mt-desert-narrows-camping-bar-harbor-me\/\">commercial campground<\/a> located in the heart of the action on Mt. Desert Island. The second week we were at <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018-schoodic-woods-campground-acadia-national-park-maine\/\">Schoodic Woods campground<\/a> located in the &#8220;quiet side&#8221; of the National Park. That week was our favorite week of the entire summer. In fact, we enjoyed <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/maine\/\">our month in Maine<\/a> very much. It is a beautiful state with friendly people.<\/p>\n<p>We also spent quite a bit of time in <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/pennsylvania\/\">Pennsylvania<\/a>.\u00a0 We had been there before, but this stay was longer and we had time to get acquainted with more areas.\u00a0 It is a great state to visit with lots to see and do.<\/p>\n<p>One change for us is that after volunteering at <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/san-jacinto-monument\/\">Battleship Texas and San Jacinto Monument<\/a> the past several years, including the opening months of 2018, we decided to take a break upon our return to the Houston area. Instead we settled into a residential RV Park in Dickinson, TX for a few months.<\/p>\n<p>This year, in spite of the enjoyable travels, wasn&#8217;t trouble free. Right off I knew I needed to take the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018\/05\/10\/2018-5th-wheel-service-in-chanute-ks\/\">5th wheel in to the factory for service<\/a>. It was a major repair and rather expensive. Then, in Indiana I had the pickup in the shop. I knew the repair was coming, but there was another big hit to the bank account. A couple of months later the pickup was back in the shop not once, but twice, for both maintenance and work again. All in all, this was our most expensive vehicle\/5th wheel year to date. These expenses will be obvious when I release our <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2020\/01\/01\/annual-expenditures-wrapup\/\">2018 expense sheet<\/a> in a few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been reminded in unwelcome ways that traveling in a RV doesn&#8217;t take us away from real life as we&#8217;ve had our share of doctor&#8217;s visits and expenses. Happily, the outcomes to this point have been reasonably good although the final chapter hasn&#8217;t been written on some issues. One silver lining to these clouds is that we&#8217;ve had a chance to affirm that traveling fulltimers can walk into most any Urgent Care and get help. Another is that all the money we spend on insurance actually gets us decent coverage. Still, I&#8217;d rather just buy the insurance without needing it!<\/p>\n<p>We still enjoy the nomadic RVing life and hope to continue for the foreseeable future. With both 5th wheel and pick-up being in the shop this year we&#8217;re thinking about doing some trading, likely to a motorhome. However, at this point we&#8217;re just thinking about it. Stay tuned on that front.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our 2018 Adventure included lots of travel.
