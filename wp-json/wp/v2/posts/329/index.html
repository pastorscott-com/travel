I searched the internet for information and, happily, found quite a bit.<\/p>\n<p>I gleaned a lot of specific information from people\u2019s blogs.  If you aren\u2019t comfortable searching Google you are missing out.  I was especially helped by several people who posted their expenditures information.  It is because of their willingness to open the door a bit to their personal lives that we\u2019ve been willing to share a bit of ours.<\/p>\n<p>There are several RV forums that contain a wealth of information.  However, in my opinion there is none better on this topic than one provided by Escapees.  Escapees is a camping club specifically for full time RVers.  I spent hours reading old threads and then began asking questions of my own.  I gleaned a ton of information there and still read the posts there every day.<\/p>\n<p>John and Kathy Huggins of Living the RV Dream are another great resource.  Their weekly podcast is positive and informative.  They have written a book about full time RVing named \u201cSo, You Want to be a Full-Time RVer?\u201d (paperback or ebook) that I recommend.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has a great deal of full time RVing information.  There\u2019s a Living the RV Dream group, a Full Time RVers group, and probably another 20 groups that provide support for this lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>When one is planning exactly where to camp, a terrific resource is RVParkReviews.com.  You\u2019ll find lots of information on campgrounds across the country.  We spend a lot of time in Thousand Trails preserves and, in addition to RVParkReviews, we get a lot of campground information from the Thousand Trails unofficial Facebook group.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, of course, I hope you\u2019ll consider this Here and There blog and it\u2019s Facebook page as a good resource for campground reviews, sightseeing information, and all things related to full time RVing.  As I\u2019ve researched potential campgrounds I\u2019ve often been frustrated that the only photos I can find are either \u201cglamor shots\u201d posted by the campground itself or people\u2019s photos of their kids or pets, etc. at the campground.  I have nothing against such photos, but I want to see some candid photos of the campsites and facilities.  I\u2019m focusing on those sort or photos for this blog while Jackie focuses on where we went and what we saw while at that campground.<\/p>\n<p>As it is when one is trying to thank everyone for their support in winning some reward, I know this post leaves out some great resources on full time RVing.  In fact, I started out to name just a couple and have had trouble finding an off ramp.  Still, the resources I\u2019ve named here are my primary ones and I hope you find them helpful.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we began planning our transition from a \u201cstix and brix\u201d lifestyle to being retired full time RVers I did considerable research on everything from budgets to campgrounds to RV upgrades.
