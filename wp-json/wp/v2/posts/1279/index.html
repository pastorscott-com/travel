The $47 per person admission is painful and, in my opinion over the top.  That isn&#8217;t to say it isn&#8217;t an impressive place.  We saw it all, well all which can be seen without spending an hour in each room picking out each individual feature.  There are interesting things everywhere from ceiling to floor, including paintings, books, sculptures, and world class furnishings.  It is all quite interesting and impressive.  As usual I maxed out in about 45 minutes.  Jackie lasts longer than I do on such things, but after a couple of hours the joy was wearing somewhat thin for her too.  Outside in the gardens was pretty neat.  Other features of the property were, in my opinion, take it or leave it.  I&#8217;d give it all 3 and a half out of 5 stars and, now that I&#8217;ve seen it I seriously doubt I&#8217;ll ever shell out the big bucks to do it again.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/P5133616.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/P5133616-300x225.jpg\" \/><\/a>I was reminded, though, of the positive side to such wealth.  Vanderbilt had more money than he knew what to do with.  In his unrestrained spending he amassed many world class things that would otherwise have been lost.  He&#8217;s long gone, but people today can appreciate the fine craftsmanship and artistry of the things he collected.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/P5133628.jpg\" style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/P5133628-300x225.jpg\" \/><\/a>As we were leaving Biltmore Jackie suggested we drive some of the Blue Ridge Parkway rather than just coming straight back to our campground.  We got on just south of Asheville and enjoyed around 3 hours of driving the amazing parkway.  I&#8217;ve been on it up in Virginia, and now I&#8217;ve seen the southern end of it.  What an amazing road across the top of the mountains!  By the way when it comes to wonderful and memorable design, God wins! <\/p>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/picasa.google.com\/blogger\/\" target=\"ext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" align=\"middle\" alt=\"Posted by Picasa\" border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/pbp.gif\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our only &#8220;big&#8221; deal on this trip is a trip to Biltmore Estate in Asheville and today was the day.
