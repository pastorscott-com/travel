After parking in a city free parking lot we rode the free trolley which let us out right at the front door and Bakery.\u00a0 I enjoyed looking and shopping with all the other people. It was crowded but everyone was good natured. After making my purchase we walked over to the Feed and Seed Store where we enjoyed the beautiful flowers and gardens. Since the line into the Bakery was long we opted to not go there.\u00a0 There were several food trucks as well.\u00a0 People were enjoying the picnic tables and the kids were having a lot of fun romping in the large play area.<\/p>\n<p>Later on, just for fun, we drove past Chip and Joanna&#8217;s restaurant, Magnolia Table.\u00a0 They had a full house, with people lined up waiting to get in.<\/p>\n<p>This is our second sightseeing review of Waco &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2015\/05\/21\/sightseeing-review-around-waco-tx\/\">the first is here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-TY42PKc8dc4\/WtjENMZioyI\/AAAAAAAAxB8\/EWWqkQqClWAkoZdKaDIixAwuSMxVU6mcQCKgBGAs\/s1600\/IMG_20180413_115412.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-TY42PKc8dc4\/WtjENMZioyI\/AAAAAAAAxB8\/EWWqkQqClWAkoZdKaDIixAwuSMxVU6mcQCKgBGAs\/s200\/IMG_20180413_115412.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"113\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>After walking about three blocks we arrived at the Dr. Pepper Museum. The tour there is self guided.\u00a0 The museum is housed in a three story building but there is an elevator if you don\u2019t want to climb the stairs. We enjoyed seeing the old corner\u00a0 drugstore with it&#8217;s beautiful woodwork and mirror. One room has early-day bottling equipment and a\u00a0 video on how the old bottle washer worked. Of particular interest to me was the artesian well that originally provided water for making the first Dr. Peppers bottled here.\u00a0 Sometime prior to World War II the well was\u00a0closed and floored over.\u00a0 The exact location was lost as the building was changed and used for other purposes across the years.\u00a0 It took some archeology to find just where, under the brick floor, the well was.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the building there are old time delivery trucks on display along with lots of Dr Pepper memorabilia.\u00a0 In the theater room you can enjoy Dr. Pepper commercials being played on a big screen.\u00a0 We were surprised at how many of those commercials we remembered!\u00a0 Scott wasn&#8217;t sure he liked watching them because he kept singing them to himself the rest of the day!\u00a0 After finishing the three stories of the museum we went across the courtyard where there were several other displays, including a very nice model railroad and a 7-Up bottling display.\u00a0 We also enjoyed Frosty\u2019s Soda Shop and gift shop. We got a couple of sodas, made the old fashioned way, by a soda jerk.\u00a0 Scott got, of course, a Dr Pepper and I opted for a root beer.\u00a0 We thought both tasted better than what you would buy in a store or from a machine.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQyOM2OCcssODh_VSfidIjpfAfmYwA0TdOVk5jzmHCkc7nSDkmcIs9LvK5PqnkRIWuRqbjHhYafWKQO\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/VXuywf3Lz3eaUNtz2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See individual photos and notes here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had a fun morning in Waco, TX at Magnolia Market of HGTV &#8220;Fixer Upper&#8221; fame.
