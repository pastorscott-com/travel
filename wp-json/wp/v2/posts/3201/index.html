I started researching the area and began seeing rave reviews of the NPS Schoodic Woods Campground, located on the Schoodic Peninsula section of the National Park. This is considered the &#8220;quiet side&#8221; of the park with Mt Desert Island containing all the famous landmarks and Schoodic being more laid back. The campground receives universally high marks. Ultimately, we decided to spend a week in the middle of the action on Mt Desert and then spend a week enjoying the serenity of the Peninsula. The booking window is 6 months and I got online the earliest day I could book for the dates of our stay. At that time there were only a few remaining available sites.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great choice. We certainly wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to miss the famous side of the park, but this campground is just great. It is located just outside the small town of Winter Harbor. The pull-through sites of Loop B are some of the longest we&#8217;ve ever seen. Spacing between the sites is also more than generous. We can see our neighbors through the trees but there&#8217;s a great feeling of privacy throughout the campground. The sites in this loop all offer 50 amp electric and water. There&#8217;s even free campground WiFi. Here&#8217;s a tip for WiFi \u2013 book sites nearer the restrooms for the strongest WiFi signals.  My Verizon worked okay, ranging from 1 to 3 bars of 4G and I had no problem getting satellite TV.<\/p>\n<p>The campground has a &#8220;dark skies&#8221; policy. That means there are no strings of LED lights, bug zappers, etc. It also means that you can sit out at night and count the shooting stars and watch satellites gliding across the sky with the backdrop of the Milky Way clearly visible.<\/p>\n<p>The roads are paved and the sites are gravel. The restrooms were always clean. You want to know that there are no showers at the campground. A few businesses in town offer showers for a price.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a NPS shuttle bus that serves the Peninsula, including stops in the two nearby small communities where there are restaurants, a small grocery, and a few shops \u2013 all can be visited without starting your own vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>If the campsites here were full hookup, or if, at least, showers were offered, I&#8217;d give Schoodic Woods a perfect score. As it is, though, it ranks as one of our favorite campgrounds of all time.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTjvDLM0FGGY_Ia2y6LvqmKMiKglhMWgt-qy8fMZOMA4MNcDLcY8qjVD0QZ1Ogj6rKn9zzam16siUuz\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/sQUmGfRUiCgZ8jqt9\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we began thinking about our 2018 Adventure we decided that Maine&#8217;s Acadia National Park would be our primary destination.
