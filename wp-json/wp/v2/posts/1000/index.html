The campground is right on the American River and &#8220;Old Scary&#8221; rapids is right in front of our camper.  It&#8217;s been fun watching rafters and kayakers navigate this (fairly easy) rapid.  We&#8217;re also about a mile downriver from Sutter&#8217;s Mill &#8211; the place where the initial gold find took place, sparking the historic California gold rush.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-d0_sMHwOdzs\/U_fa8MOqL9I\/AAAAAAAAfbU\/hbaFU3P5XkU\/s144-c-o\/PHOTO_20140821_121001.jpg\"\/> In addition to watching the rafters we&#8217;ve been entertained by paragliders who launched from the mountain just across the river from us and glided on the air currents for nearly an hour and also by hardy fellow campers panning for gold in the cold water.  One fellow showed me a small vial with several flecks of gold he had found that day.  Others fished for trout and reported some limited success on that front.<\/p>\n<p>Satellite TV was reasonably easy to get and my Verizon 4G has a decent 3 bars of signal strength.  We&#8217;ve really enjoyed our relaxing spot on the river and hope to return someday. <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRMMZGfR6bcyzW8CXhW_ELWBJGV2O6Gekaqrm2dPEDjpimeWcLKZ9ewL2rFvL---a810FuHdO8la0pB\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I think Ponderosa Thousand Trails is one of the most scenic campgrounds we&#8217;ve been in on our 2014 adventure.
