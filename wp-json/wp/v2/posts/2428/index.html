We stayed in Farm Island State Recreation Area on the edge of town. Although it was cool in the morning when I walked it warmed up in the afternoon so we went into town for an ice cream cone and a few groceries. We stopped by the state capitol and saw the beautiful grounds including a park area with the Veteran&#8217;s Memorial and fountain. At one time there was enough natural gas in the water that a flame was lit from it, causing fire to &#8220;float&#8221; above the water.  However, the level of natural gas has dropped and, while there is still the odor of gas, it is no longer the famous &#8220;flaming fountain.&#8221;  There are several walking paths and another flowing fountain as well. Afterward we went to a busy Zestos ice cream for a tasty cone. As we drove around town I saw beautiful old buildings, many biking-hiking trails, and lovely homes with playgrounds nearby. For shoppers there is a Walmart, Menards, and small shopping Mall.  While Pierre isn\u2019t a tourist destination, we did enjoy some relaxing downtime there.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR32p-HesNFQYw4hjB9RRzkpX9YoStVVDuWPXb8xI_CzTTr7c_RCR_z1xmEOxzYe2CvOIqmR5NNZLvb\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With less than 14,000 residents, Pierre, South Dakota is the second smallest state capital.
