In our case, we had already decided to shorten our travel adventure this year as we are serving as interim pastor at Houston&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.swcnaz.org\/\">Southwest Church of the Nazarene<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And, not that this will come as a surprise to you, summers in Texas are hot! In our case, we are near the Gulf Coast, so not only is it hot but it is humid too. Not a fun mix. Not only that, but there&#8217;s no shade.<\/p>\n<p>Our motorhome has two air conditioners. The bedroom a\/c does a good job of keeping things cool. The living room unit, though, struggles to keep up. We&#8217;ve made six adjustments that make a big difference.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Of course, we keep the <strong>front window curtains<\/strong> drawn. Not only that, but we have <strong>giant sunshades<\/strong> (similar to what people use in their cars) for these windows. We certainly miss the view out of\u00a0 our big &#8220;picture window&#8221; but this is the number one thing that keeps things comfortable in our living room.<\/li>\n<li>It probably goes without saying, but I keep an eye on the <strong>air conditioner filters<\/strong>. Running as much as the units are, the filters need cleaning a couple of times a month. Our units also have &#8220;Quick Cool&#8221; (or &#8220;air dump&#8221;) vents. We open them to dump a lot of cold air straight down into the RV, rather than running air through the vents where the heat from the roof warms the air a bit.<\/li>\n<li>Another big improvement is adding <strong>Reflectix<\/strong> to several windows. This is a heat reflecting insulation that is cut to fit. We have put this product on our west facing windows as well as on other seldom used windows.<\/li>\n<li>The next thing we have done is install <strong>curtains<\/strong> the width of the rig behind the driver&#8217;s\/passenger&#8217;s seats, creating a sort of vestibule. This keeps the cool air from the a\/c concentrated in our living room and kitchen and helps trap the warm air from opening the front door in the front of the rig. There&#8217;s around\u00a0 a 5 degree difference between the driving area and the living room.<\/li>\n<li>We are running a couple of <strong>electric fans<\/strong> that keep the air moving. One of the fans is an oscillating tower that makes a nice difference.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, as long as the hot wind isn&#8217;t blowing too hard, in the afternoons we leave the <strong>awning<\/strong> extended on the curb side of the rig. This shades the west side of the motorhome and keeps the walls from heating up.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We know that <strong>the best RV summer solution<\/strong> is moving to a cooler spot. However, there are times when that isn&#8217;t possible and &#8220;all the above&#8221; does help us stay comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>So what are your tips for weathering summer heat and humidity in a RV?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Like a lot of people our travel plans have been preempted by the pandemic.
