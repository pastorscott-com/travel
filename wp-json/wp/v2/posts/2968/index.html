Our visit began at the museum where we enjoyed going through the interactive dioramas with monitors playing clips of movies based on various books written by Samuel Clemens. The ones I enjoyed most were the cave where Tom and Becky were lost and Tom\u2019s raft where he and runaway Jim had their adventures. Many of his other popular books are represented by film clips and dioramas. We saw a mockup of a pilot\u2019s wheelhouse with a whistle and other items from the Mississippi Steamboat era that inspired Samuel Clemens to write his books. The museum also has first editions of all his books, original Norman Rockwell illustrations from them, and personal memorabilia from his life. From the Museum we walked a few blocks to Clemens boyhood home and the Becky Thatcher house which was actually the home of Laura Hawkins who was the inspiration for Becky. We also saw the Huckleberry Finn House which was home to Tom Blankenship who was the inspiration for Huck. Finally, we toured the John M. Clemens Justice of the Peace office. From there we returned to the museum for the highlight of our time in Hannibal. A very talented actor entertained us for around 30 minutes as Samuel Clemens. We thoroughly enjoyed his presentation and highly recommend it to all, young and old alike.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"504\" height=\"284\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G8T9m9tbuhk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/RX14UK2nx2maubDU6\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had a fun afternoon at the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal, Missouri.
