The scenery is beautiful and the wildlife is abundant. The river flows along the boundary and is a popular place for tubing. There\u2019s a wild turkey habitat plus numerous deer and other animals like armadillos. There is also a wide variety of birds. The park has many trails of varying lengths and difficulty. I hiked to the top of the scenic overlook. It wasn\u2019t far, but the steepness of the hike left me out of breath.<\/p>\n<p>The campground offers 30 amp and water hookups. All sites are paved and reasonably level front to back. Most of the sites have shelters with picnic tables. There are no pull-throughs, but the sites are angled making for easier back in. The park itself is five miles south of Junction and I10.<\/p>\n<p>We had good roaming Verizon cell service but no data. Satellite TV was fairly easy to get. In spite of the popularity of the river, during portions of the year the park closes almost all river access except for five hours each day to allow the large turkey population undisturbed roosting. Because of the restrictions of river use during a good part of the year I\u2019d say this park doesn\u2019t quite measure up to Garner State Park for river access but still, it\u2019s a good one and well worth a visit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos South Llano River State Park, located at Junction, TX and about 100 miles west of San Antonio is another great Texas Hill Country state park.
