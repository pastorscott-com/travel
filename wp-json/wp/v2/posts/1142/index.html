Our destination was the great northwestern United States with a focus on the Pacific coast.  It was a wonderful trip \u2013 really, everything we hoped it would be.  Early in our journey we found southeastern Utah to be a pleasant surprise.  We\u2019ve heard so much about the vicinity of Moab; especially Arches and Canyonlands National Parks.  These were even better than we expected and some of the most beautiful spots we\u2019ve ever been.<\/p>\n<p>We spent a couple of months visiting different places along the Washington coast and then another month along the Oregon coast.  We loved it all and I especially enjoyed the splendor of the Oregon coast.  If a person loves nature they will love that area.<\/p>\n<p>We continued into northern California and soon moved inland to the Sacramento area and points east and south.  After wearing jackets and even needing heat in the camper the warm temperatures were a shock to the system.  Still, camping along the whitewater of the American River and then staying in the high country of Yosemite was a real pleasure.<br \/>\nIt was with some sadness that we turned east and headed for Arizona because that meant we were now winding down our big Adventure.\u00a0 Still, we\u2019re talking about Arizona here; long one of our favorite states.\u00a0 We spent a month there, working our way from the northwest corner of the state to ultimately exit at the southeast corner.<\/p>\n<p>Before long we were back in Texas \u2013 enjoying the splendor of the state\u2019s southwest.\u00a0 We\u2019ve always liked the Texas State Parks and it was a pleasure to visit three of them, especially Davis Mountains State Park, as we worked our way east.<\/p>\n<p>After almost seven months we\u2019ve now arrived back where the Adventure began: Lake Conroe Thousand Trails. We towed the 5<sup>th<\/sup> wheel about 6300 miles and then drove about the same distance sightseeing and \u201cjust living.\u201d\u00a0 We stayed in about 40 different campgrounds, generally for a week and a half at a time with several shorter stays when we were in \u201crepositioning mode.\u201d\u00a0 In January I\u2019ll release our budget figures but we pretty much stayed on target through the year.<\/p>\n<p>It was a great trip and I\u2019m already looking forward to return visits to and through these areas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve now wrapped up our 2014 Adventure.
