We opted to use our Verizon service which has an acceptable 3G connect.  Cable TV is provided and there&#8217;s a laundry and some worn bathrooms.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say that the campground is a bit below average, but the location is very good. <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR7p4S2jH0c0SS8qkjsf42gpvZ1Tb_e7AhmwCBWEdbyefOdV7xJHB9fOTLG0N8JN3W9YgWN3CRXACzC\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The draw here is that the Smith River pours into the Pacific right at the campground.
