After leaving the falls we hiked on up the trail for about a half hour before deciding we had had enough for the day.

We have the awning up and are sitting outside enjoying the 65 degree mountain air. Tomorrow we head up into the GSMNP for some camping. That means no Internet, no cell phone, no electricity. It also means quiet, majestic beauty. It sounds like a good trade to me.<\/p>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/picasa.google.com\/blogger\/\" target=\"ext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" align=\"middle\" alt=\"Posted by Picasa\" border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/pbp.gif\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This morning we hiked a short trail to Juneywhank Falls in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Bryson City, NC.
