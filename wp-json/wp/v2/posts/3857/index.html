The Library takes visitors on an audio-visual journey of Billy Graham\u2019s life from the time of his conversion until his death in 2018. He attended Wheaton College where he met and married a missionary\u2019s daughter, Ruth Bell Graham. One room is dedicated to his wife Ruth and her many accomplishments as wife, mother and writer. There are movie clips from various crusades and many personal items from his years of ministry including what looks like the sound room where he recorded his radio broadcast, The Hour of Decision, produced from 1950 to 2016!  Near the end of the tour we saw a wall mural by Thomas Kinkade named \u201cThe Cross\u201d. In the final presentation of the tour we heard a short video of Billy Graham preaching the gospel message.  At the end of the sermon, as &#8220;Just as I Am&#8221; is being sung, his son Franklin appears on video, encouraging those of us in the room to respond to that invitation.  The overwhelming theme of the library continues Graham\u2019s lifetime calling of leading people to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSqxfFLCDRw9yFLpTfwvvxEpg__-aljvHa231KMb7dx_RbtHX7Hs2tyNPohUSnEBClziwC0Li3TunrX\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I thoroughly enjoyed our visit the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, NC.
