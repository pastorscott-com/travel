This is an older campground that is showing its age.  We ended up in an area with a crew of construction workers.  The hard working people left early in the morning and returned in the evening.   Some of the campsites are set up with sites \u201cback to back\u201d so our neighbor\u2019s 20 year old travel trailer on the driver\u2019s side was pretty close.  I\u2019m sure we could have stayed in a different site had I asked.  (Note to self: speak up!)  The bathhouse was clean, but worn.   After we were starting to set up I realized that there had been a sewer backup on the site on the other side of our camper at some point that needed to be cleaned up.  However, someone cleaned it up shortly after that.  Wall Drug is close by and if you don\u2019t mind walking across some railroad tracks, it is easy walking distance.  Speaking of the railroad tracks, we heard, I think just one train a day and none at night.  One of the entrances to Badlands National Park is just a few miles south of town.  Campground WiFi wasn\u2019t very good but my Verizon 4G was fine.  I had no problem getting my Dish Network satellites.  On a future trip I think I\u2019d try the other park or maybe forgo staying at or around Wall and just drive out from the Rapid City area.  <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRrzpBLNbPtOkGwq50Q8rP4-5b8pfITBzvzGNd9w0_LEQnm4gMViJWQYr068WsapcrhZwTsNq5NEWrB\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were looking for a campground with full hookups near Badlands National Park and Wall Drug and Arrow Campground in Wall, SD was one of our two choices.
