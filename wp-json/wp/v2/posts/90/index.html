Two computers are dedicated to the children. There is a History\/Genealogy corner for those wanting to do research and two study spaces if someone needs a quiet place to work. The study spaces can be reserved or are available if no is using them. There is also a Conference Room available to the public for meetings and receptions by reservation. Outside the library next to the parking lot is a lovely gazebo open to the public as a place to come sit, read and enjoy.
