We were blessed by the good worship service at College Church on Olivet Nazarene University campus &#8211; our first time to worship there in nearly 50 years! After lunch with Lee and Marilyn and a quick visit to their beautiful home we headed back to the University. It has grown and prospered since we met on this campus and began our lives together. We found a few memorable spots (like where we met for the very first time). Scott noticed that for some reason there was no plaque marking the spot. He is sure that the missing plaque is just a temporary omission that will be fixed soon.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"504\" height=\"284\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hHdLXKDvjqU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/GAWDSEIumAOkDy003\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><br \/>\n<\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had a pleasant Day in Bourbonnais, Illinois seeing long time friends Lee and Marilyn Turner along with a short visit with Scott\u2019s cousin Phillis and William Harris.
