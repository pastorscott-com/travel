Knowing the Artic cold front was coming, we only hooked up electricity.  <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2020\/08\/25\/2020-high-view-coe-campground-ennis-tx\/\">As I said in my previous review<\/a>, the water hookup is behind the back of the sites.  My heated hose isn&#8217;t nearly long enough to reach that far.  Not only that, but the water hookup is just a bare pipe sticking up about 3 feet out of the ground.  By morning, the water was frozen up, so hooking up would have been a waste of time.  The cold weather brought winter storm conditions, especially south of us so we decided to just stay put a couple of extra days.  One of the nice things about living in a RV full time is that you always have the option to &#8220;run&#8221; from threatening weather or to hunker down and wait out challenging travel conditions.  After three nights, though, we were ready to head south again.<\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed the nice lake view out our front window.  We also enjoyed seeing a large flock of cardinals &#8211; I counted 19 of the pretty red birds in our &#8220;back yard.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-Uuxe_pKsJuo\/YCctPAyF2iI\/AAAAAAABIiE\/QHM_5iOmm482qVzpHgpf1MbAZ2E1L5DfgCPcBGAsYHg\/s1600\/P2110063.JPG\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" \/> <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-nlzdCAGL7wM\/YCcuszEgQ6I\/AAAAAAABIiY\/9f_8Va3BXKkbuXMgD0QXNrcZ_inDBIDxQCPcBGAsYHg\/s4032\/IMG_20210209_172345.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium\" \/> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We got away from Lake Texoma Thousand Trails on Monday afternoon, so the 140 miles down to High View CoE in Ennis, TX was just about the right distance.
