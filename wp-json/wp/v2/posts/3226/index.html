The park recently added a Bear Creek Campground that features cabins, teepees, a tenting area, and, of course, a large RV area.  The campsites are laid out with water-electric hookups located in a shared grassy area on the driver&#8217;s side of the sites.  If the place is full, there will be a shared front yard between campers as well.  Most people, I think, come to spend a few days at the amusement park.  There&#8217;s even a shuttle operating from the campground to the main gate of the park.  <\/p>\n<p>Our shortstop stay was just for one night as we traveled from southern Maine into Pennsylvania.  The campground is about 10 minutes from I84 and the campsites are all pull-through, making it a handy place for an overnight stay.  When I asked about discounts the lady I talked to on the phone offered me a nightly rate based on a three night stay rather than just one night.  <\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things you might want to know.  The sites are all water\/electric (30\/50 amp), no sewer.  Individual shower rooms are available.  There is campground WiFi &#8211; ours got slower as the evening progressed.  There&#8217;s a nearby power plant that can be heard non-stop in the near distance.  <\/p>\n<p>I had a strong 4G signal and, since the campsites are pretty much out in the open, satellite TV is no problem.    The campground has a play area, but the main recreation is the amusement park.  I think Bear Creek is a good choice for a stop in the Bristol, CT area.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQffPlMl_tRY50l15tc9IY0kkCOEihp5cblkmTuFdgi4aRV4w2qM2hsaB39zDVdZFUIl4zh2o0ZrKjH\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/UBKEKr71YJNYpGANA\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut is the oldest continually operating amusement park in the United States.
