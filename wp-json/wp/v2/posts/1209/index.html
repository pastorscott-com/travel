It takes another train ride of about an hour to get there.&nbsp; Let me say that the British trains are very good.&nbsp; They are smooth and quiet.&nbsp; The seats are a bit narrow, but aside from that, they are a great way to travel.&nbsp; The trains are so quiet that people talk to one another (of course, no eye contact or conversations with strangers!) in subdued tones.&nbsp; As we did on our way to the Cotswolds we rode in a \u201cquiet car\u201d \u2013 no cell phones or music.&nbsp; It was a restful, interesting ride out to and back from Windsor.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/PA037700.jpg\" style=\"clear: right;

It\u2019s an amazing place to visit.&nbsp; The castle has been there for centuries, but the walls are like new.&nbsp; The Queen doesn\u2019t allow pictures to be taken inside of any building, so I snapped away while outside, but put the camera away as we viewed the Queen\u2019s dollhouse (filled with miniatures \u2013 it even has a working plumbing system).&nbsp; If you\u2019ve never heard of it, google it \u2013 it\u2019s really neat.&nbsp; Then we took a long and interesting walk through the royal apartments.&nbsp; Every room has portraits of famous members of the royal families painted by famous artists.&nbsp; The ceilings are works of art, the furniture pieces are all works of art; there\u2019s gold and silver, weapon displays, banners, and lots of other impressive stuff.&nbsp; Some of the rooms are basically part of a museum (\u201cNapoleon slept here\u201d), while others are actually used for state activities.&nbsp; Right now the Queen isn\u2019t in residence there, but will be shortly.&nbsp; That\u2019s actually a good thing because we were able to view some rooms that won\u2019t be available to the public once she arrives.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

Again, no photos, but it\u2019s quite a place to visit.&nbsp; Lots of kings and queens and other royals are buried in the church, and the Quire (I\u2019d call it the \u201csanctuary\u201d) has seats for the \u201cKnights of Windsor.\u201d&nbsp; There are shields for all the knights over their seats, and then, there\u2019s an impressive sword and shield for the current knight who claims his place at the church.<\/p>\n<p>We stayed for the Evensong service and just happened to be there for a special memorial service for one of the Windsor Knights who recently passed away.&nbsp; We heard another all male choir (the boy sopranos in particular were impressive).&nbsp; However, the most interesting thing was the processional of around twelve Knights of Windsor.&nbsp; These are all older men, mostly heroes from WWII.&nbsp; They were dressed in what reminded me of Admiral outfits: red coats with tails, feathered hats, etc.&nbsp; These men have all had distinguished military careers now and serve St. Georges.&nbsp; There was lots of scripture and singing (obviously, quite \u201chigh church\u201d) and a sort of memorial sermon by the man\u2019s son.&nbsp; We would have felt like intruders except for the fact that we, once again, found ourselves sitting in the Nave rather than in the Quire.&nbsp; We could see through the opening into the service and hear everything quite well, but were actually sitting outside the service.&nbsp; As I understand it, normally visitors are invited into the main sanctuary for the daily Evensong service but since there were many dignitaries there those seats were reserved for them.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t think Jackie or I would have wanted to be inside anyway, we were way underdressed for the occasion as I left my Admiral suit home on this trip.&nbsp;
