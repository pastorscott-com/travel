there\u2019s gold and silver, weapon displays, banners, and lots of other impressive stuff.\u00a0 Some of the rooms are basically part of a museum (\u201cNapoleon slept here\u201d), while others are actually used for state activities.\u00a0 Right now the Queen isn\u2019t in residence there, but will be shortly.\u00a0 That\u2019s actually a good thing because we were able to view some rooms that won\u2019t be available to the public once she arrives.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;
