line. &nbsp;There was probably 200 people in the &#8220;we-just-showed-up&#8221; line. &nbsp;When we concluded our visit in just over an hour there were no people in the first line, they just showed up on time and walked through security. &nbsp;There were probably 500 people in the second line. &nbsp;The moral of the story: buy advance tickets!<\/p>\n<p>So up we went. &nbsp;Jackie and heights don&#8217;t get along but she agreed to travel with me to the second level and I agreed to not try to drag her any closer to heaven than that. &nbsp;Really, the views from level 2 are terrific and many people claim that it&#8217;s the best level for picking out landmarks. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t enter that debate because we opted to enjoy our time on the tower together. &nbsp;The views of the city are wonderful and I took lots of pictures as well as just enjoyed trying to recognize some of the places we had already seen.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

line and breeze through the &#8220;we&#8217;ve-got-a-museum-pass&#8221; line. &nbsp;Knowing we could never see it all, we opted for Rick Steves&#8217; Paris book. &nbsp;He has a tour in it and we followed it the best we were able.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;
