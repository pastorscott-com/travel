line. \u00a0There was probably 200 people in the &#8220;we-just-showed-up&#8221; line. \u00a0When we concluded our visit in just over an hour there were no people in the first line, they just showed up on time and walked through security. \u00a0There were probably 500 people in the second line. \u00a0The moral of the story: buy advance tickets!<\/p>\n<p>So up we went. \u00a0Jackie and heights don&#8217;t get along but she agreed to travel with me to the second level and I agreed to not try to drag her any closer to heaven than that. \u00a0Really, the views from level 2 are terrific and many people claim that it&#8217;s the best level for picking out landmarks. \u00a0I can&#8217;t enter that debate because we opted to enjoy our time on the tower together. \u00a0The views of the city are wonderful and I took lots of pictures as well as just enjoyed trying to recognize some of the places we had already seen.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;
