This campground is very well laid out with wide roads and easily navigated campsites. The property is exceptionally well maintained. I think this is the only place we have ever stayed that has a built in sprinkler system! This keeps the grass looking good even in the middle of hot north Texas summers.<\/p>\n<p>The facilities are well done \u2013 with nice laundry, showers and bathrooms. There&#8217;s also a fitness center and club house. Everything is kept perfectly clean.<\/p>\n<p>The doggie park gets a lot of use. This resort caters to adults; there&#8217;s no playground but there is a nice outdoor pool. There is decent WiFi and Direct TV.<\/p>\n<p>There are several people who are there long term. Many of them are in beautiful, newer motorhomes and 5th wheels. For &#8220;long timers&#8221; large rental propane bottles are available. We were glad to take advantage of this as the winter temperatures dipped below freezing many nights.<\/p>\n<p>We appreciated the helpful staff. They went out of their way to take care of their guests. More than once I saw the owner park a new guest&#8217;s RV for them. When I arrived I was glad to park my own rig, but someone was right there to guide me in and then to start hooking my utilities up.<\/p>\n<p>We were a bit disappointed that there was no lake access at the resort. Still, there is a big marina right down the road with restaurants, boat rentals, and fishing guide services.<\/p>\n<p>This RV resort isn&#8217;t exactly handy to folks traveling Highway 75 at the Texas-Oklahoma state line. I think it&#8217;s a little over 10 miles west of that major highway. The roads are good, but there are a few turns to get to the resort. Also, you might want to know that the campground does enforce their check in time (1:00 pm as of this writing). If you arrive before that, you won&#8217;t be allowed to check in.<\/p>\n<p>As you might guess, a resort offering this level of service isn&#8217;t going to be a budget campground. At the same time, it is nice to feel spoiled once in a while.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSs4H4NDssBO3kK5FiJhYyBzvh323HYiHEgwBMahq7dfr_xtpXERYy_lHcx5C8R4zHtQ6BVtu7WP27q\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lake Texoma RV Resort is one of the nicer places we&#8217;ve stayed in in our years of fulltiming.
