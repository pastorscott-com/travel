Rather than rehash previous reviews I&#8217;m going to focus on just the new section (Section B) which is near the entry gate.  It seems strange to us to be set up in a nice campground loop that we remember as a big, unused field.  Even now new construction continues as vacation cottages are being built adjacent to the new Loop.  There&#8217;s a lot to like about this section.  The roads are very good and the campsites are all concrete, including a large concrete patio on each site.  There are several pull through sites in addition to nice, easy access back in sites.  As you can guess this new area of the campground is quite popular and sites in it don&#8217;t stay vacant for long.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there are some things you might want to know about &#8220;B Loop.&#8221;  As nice as the sites look, several are rather sloped.  Pay attention to the back in sites closest to the big retaining wall.  The sites aren&#8217;t all sloped, but some motorhomes had tires a considerable distance off the ground as people tried to get level.  People in 5th wheels can get by better than those in longer motorhomes, but some have considerable piles of blocks under their jacks.  On the other hand we were backed into a beautiful site on the north side of the section and got level front to back without much effort.  I wouldn&#8217;t even try some of the other sites.  <\/p>\n<p>The only other thing to think about is that the new section is a ways from the Activity Center, the pool, and especially the lake.  If you have children who want to spend time at the basketball, tennis, and mini-golf facilities you might be happier in a campsite closer to the center of the campground. In that case, the real plus of the new section for you is that there are more sites available in sections of the campground closer to the recreation facilities.   <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTdaV8YvtdVKHpKyfKyHPUrFEuGZLeZyLd6qDNDcRa_Dew1gOYZZ6_Yd3ufBh7gqJd_TyqCRkUafHBt\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve stayed at Lake Conroe Thousand Trails near Conroe, TX several times and I&#8217;ve written several reviews of the place.
