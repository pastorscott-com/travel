Shoreline RV Park gets decent internet reviews and happens to be in the right place for us. The park has easy access from 101 &#8211; although entry is a bit strange. Highway 101 is split here, so if you are traveling south you have to pass the place, turn at a light, and then return to the park. However, the turn isn&#8217;t into the park, rather, it&#8217;s for a Circle K gas station or a Harley dealer. You drive between the two right into the park. Leaving and continuing north is easy enough, but it includes driving a different street to get back to a place where you can get back to the southbound side of 101.<\/p>\n<p>The RV park is all paved and boasts very long but narrow pull through sites with narrow strips of grass between sites. The WiFi is good and the restrooms and laundry room are modern and clean. The sewer hookup is at the very back of the sites so you&#8217;ll need a longer hose to reach it. There&#8217;s no pool or any other amenities. We paid around $37 a night which makes this one of the more expensive stays we&#8217;ve had.<\/p>\n<p>This RV park is no vacation destination, but if you need a spot in Eureka and are willing to pay the price this is a good place to stop.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRZl5oQgdUicbKEODTTNXnE6jX0dDabDkhSt0TLqxVS8QcnAC9VkPodNGxBv_YSnbHKnGiczO6w-vvR\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our two day stay in Eureka, CA was just one of three stops we made to break up our repositioning move from the Oregon coast to the Sacramento area.
