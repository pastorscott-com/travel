The location is handy, just 25 miles south of San Jose and the southern bay area. The campground facilities are pretty good. I\u2019d say that the center piece is a large, nice pool. There\u2019s also mini-golf, horseshoes, volleyball, and other nice features, all in pretty good shape.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand the campsites are average at best. None have full hookups and many are rather crowded with campsites basically back to back with no room between them. The 50 amp section not only has a $5 surcharge but those campsites are pretty tight. The section across the road from the pool is, I think, the best. It has larger campsites and is handy to much of the activity section of the facility.<\/p>\n<p>Several campsites are being leased to annuals and we felt that there was a larger percentage of older trailers in the campground than we usually see. Of course they are mixed in with the usual mix of 5th wheels and motorhomes. There are also three sections set aside specifically for tenters.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re in a 30 amp site and in the afternoons voltage drops into the 107-108 volt range. We\u2019ve kept an eye on the more power hungry appliances and been careful to not double up on them. With September afternoon temperatures hitting the mid-90\u2019s we\u2019ve given the air conditioner priority. Usually by late afternoon the temps drop and overnight we\u2019ve slept under blankets.<\/p>\n<p>I think most people who want it manage to get a satellite signal and our Verizon is getting a 2 bar usable signal. In the booster cradle it hits a solid 4 bars.<\/p>\n<p>Our weekend was interesting. As we arrived we found that many sites had signs on them saying the site wouldn&#8217;t be available over the weekend. On Friday a large group from a local school began to arrive. This all school camping trip is a longtime annual tradition. By evening there were tents, kids, and adults everywhere. Our campsite was right on the edge of the group and when all was said and done we were surrounded by tenters, with one tent pitched almost under our bedroom slide and two right outside our back window! However, the group was friendly and happy and we enjoyed them enjoying the campground. If every camping experience was like this we wouldn&#8217;t like it very much. However, for just two nights it was no big deal. It exposes a lot of people to the camping experience and I&#8217;m sure it generates a lot of income for the campground. Anyway, if you are planning a visit to Morgan Hill you might want to keep this second weekend of September annual event in mind!<\/p>\n<p>If I were grading Morgan Hill Thousand Trails I&#8217;d give it a &#8220;B&#8221; on facilities and a &#8220;C-&#8221; on campsites. It&#8217;s a commitment but San Francisco is within striking distance for a day trip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff This campground is a mixed bag.
