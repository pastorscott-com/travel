As we arrived we found that many sites had signs on them saying the site wouldn&#8217;t be available over the weekend. On Friday a large group from a local school began to arrive. This all school camping trip is a longtime annual tradition. By evening there were tents, kids, and adults everywhere. Our campsite was right on the edge of the group and when all was said and done we were surrounded by tenters, with one tent pitched almost under our bedroom slide and two right outside our back window! However, the group was friendly and happy and we enjoyed them enjoying the campground. If every camping experience was like this we wouldn&#8217;t like it very much. However, for just two nights it was no big deal. It exposes a lot of people to the camping experience and I&#8217;m sure it generates a lot of income for the campground. Anyway, if you are planning a visit to Morgan Hill you might want to keep this second weekend of September annual event in mind!<\/p>\n<p>If I were grading Morgan Hill Thousand Trails I&#8217;d give it a &#8220;B&#8221; on facilities and a &#8220;C-&#8221; on campsites. It&#8217;s a commitment but San Francisco is within striking distance for a day trip.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Our weekend was interesting.
