We\u2019ve had extremes of weather, with lots of rain, including flash flood warnings, and then the hottest days we\u2019ve seen in a long time with our a\/c not being able to keep up with the heat and super-high humidity.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, we thoroughly enjoyed time with our son and family as they timed a trip to Branson to coincide with our being here. We especially liked our day with them at Silver Dollar City. In spite of times of rain downpours courtesy of the remnants of tropical storm Bill it was a lot of fun. One good thing about it was that we didn\u2019t mind getting wet on some of the water rides since we were already pretty wet as it was!<\/p>\n<p>The campground itself has around 70 sites, most of them back in, with one row of pull-throughs. The sites are somewhat small and your neighbor to the back of the campsite is within a couple of feet of you. I think all the sites are full hookup and several are 50 amp. There\u2019s a bit more space side to side. We\u2019ve found Escapees members to be some of the friendliest RVers around and it\u2019s easy to strike up a conversation here. There\u2019s an activity center, office, and laundry but really, the draw here is Branson and all it has to offer rather than the campground.<\/p>\n<p>Near the campground (at Hollister City Hall) there\u2019s a short, paved trail to Hackett Falls. It\u2019s a small, pretty waterfall. After all the rain we had, the water flow was great when we went there. Even without all the rain, you might want to check it out.<\/p>\n<p>The campground is bordered by Turkey Creek and because of all the rain we\u2019ve kept an eye on the water level. The creek has been a few feet above its banks all the time we\u2019ve been here. Then, when the deluge of rain finally stopped and we thought we were home free, the officials at Table Rock dam announced a water release to take pressure off the dam. That meant another night of keeping an eye on the creek water level. That, thankfully, turned out to be a non-concern.<\/p>\n<p>If nothing else, Turkey Creek is handy to Branson, with one of the primary shopping areas, Branson Landing, being only minutes away.<\/p>\n<p>My satellite TV was easy enough to set up and I enjoyed a good Verizon 4G cell signal. All in all, this has been a good place for us, especially because of our Escapees connection and the camping discount we got here. We\u2019ll likely return here on future trips to and through Branson.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff Our week at Turkey Creek RV Village, the Escapees Park in Hollister, MO, has been an interesting one.
