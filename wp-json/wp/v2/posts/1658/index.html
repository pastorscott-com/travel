It\u2019s a small, pretty waterfall.  After all the rain we had, the water flow was great when we went there.  Even without all the rain, you might want to check it out.<\/p>\n<p>The campground is bordered by Turkey Creek and because of all the rain we\u2019ve kept an eye on the water level.  The creek has been a few feet above its banks all the time we\u2019ve been here.  Then, when the deluge of rain finally stopped and we thought we were home free, the officials at Table Rock dam announced a water release to take pressure off the dam.  That meant another night of keeping an eye on the creek water level.  That, thankfully, turned out to be a non-concern.  <\/p>\n<p>If nothing else, Turkey Creek is handy to Branson, with one of the primary shopping areas, Branson Landing, being only minutes away.   <\/p>\n<p>My satellite TV was easy enough to set up and I enjoyed a good Verizon 4G cell signal.  All in all, this has been a good place for us, especially because of our Escapees connection and the camping discount we got here.  We\u2019ll likely return here on future trips to and through Branson.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRcMZ-J_VUQnmRpJ2phOE4OrpOy7DYZY-k2vePxc8lRYQLGBwIvPP0AXH_MXKcsW2XsN4H-FjVBTRVr\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Near the campground (at Hollister City Hall) there\u2019s a short, paved trail to Hackett Falls.
