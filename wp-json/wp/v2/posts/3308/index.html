In our setup, the only way to see out to back window down to the hitch is to prop yourself up at a strange angle in the seat, twisting around while keeping your foot on the fuel peddle, ready to switch to the brake.  My neck and back don&#8217;t work very well for that kind of Jujutsu move anymore so I looked around for a cheap alternative.<\/p>\n<p>My solution was a wide angle lens that sticks to the back window of the truck.  The lens &#8220;bends the light&#8221; letting me look through the rear-view mirror and see the hitch.  To help things out, I put some fluorescent tape on both the edge of the hitch and the front of the hitch.<\/p>\n<p>Once I put the wide angle lens on the window and tried it out, I took scissors and cut it in half, using only the bottom half on the window.  That kept the lens low enough that I can look through the rear view mirror when driving without the camper and not see much of the lens at all.<\/p>\n<p>This setup has been surprisingly helpful.  I line things up without turning around at all, just looking in the mirror as I back up to the 5th wheel. Admittedly, there&#8217;s a bit of a learning curve, but this set up works well, especially when you consider the low cost.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTtcaAVdJzKDMrZdoiB71cNWh1KbOZ0gZr-9Ey8K8npKC3350TVn93aUH1amIuA6Hi0zClNXfRJDvfq\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\nSee individual photos with captions.<\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know that there are nifty bed mount cameras for this, but I was looking for a low tech solution and found one that I am sharing with you.
