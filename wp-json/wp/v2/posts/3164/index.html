The campground is on the Saco River and has a variety of campsites including many seasonal sites, grassy water\/electric sites, FHU back-in sites, and a number of tent sites near the river.  We opted for a 30 amp, FHU spot and really liked it.  Our site was spacious and bordered by evergreens on both sides, providing a nice level of privacy.   The campground has several farm animals, including horses, and a large children&#8217;s play area.  There&#8217;s a nice swimming area on the river that got a lot of use over the weekend.  The campground wasn&#8217;t cheap, but compared to many in the area it was as good or better than most.   We think Homestead is a nice campground and we recommend it to those looking for a spot in the area.  My Verizon data was good and I had no problem getting satellite TV.  The free campground WiFi was usable, but a bit slow.  You can pay for an upgrade to campground WiFi if you want.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTzJG5wuYJOefi8IJ5h57tWNQ1SmoyKt8JpQZXzWBzgEfvAoCY9BEaBm8ZTsISLdXFTU93Th9WRSOL1\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/nFf99cKNeZVRkpXq5\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We enjoyed our time at Homestead by the River Family Campground, at Biddeford, Maine.
