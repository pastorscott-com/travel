This time, with near record setting heat, we made a few return visits but mostly enjoyed the campground and some downtime.<\/p>\n<p>We did, though, want to revisit Bird-in-Hand, a town well known for its Amish food and shops. One of the favorite places there is the Farmers Market. On the main level we found all kinds of foods ranging from fresh baked goods, meats, cheese, candies, prepackaged mixes, and food to buy and eat on the spot. We bought fresh, hot pretzels, butter cheese, and Lebanon bologna. The market also has a variety of crafts and tourist items for sale.<\/p>\n<p>Near Bird-in-Hand is Good and Plenty Restaurant. We very much enjoyed a meal there. The fried chicken and apple pie was terrific. Also, near our campground at Mt Gretna is a well known ice cream and burger restaurant called the Jigger Shop. We tried their trademark concoction &#8211; a million calorie sundae called &#8220;a jigger.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I wanted to return to Hershey Chocolate World. The oversized candy bars made great photo opportunities and the shopping in the store was fun. I enjoyed the free ride through a chocolate factory, singing candy bars and singing cows and all. The highlight of our entire say was that on our way toward the door a lady asked Scott if he would take a picture of her and her husband. He recognized them as friends we hadn\u2019t seen in years! They now make their home in Missouri and have been in the area for just a week. Seeing Pat and Donna after nearly 20 years was one of those &#8220;small world&#8221; experiences and an unexpected blessing.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRkyPSzVZJxiAGY_jA01J49fAU-40YyZ7xnYf11ySyeIMd6AhHPSxK8nSMLlCt6K91kfe4_DLdjWnjC\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/a9RQvrG8gwMZDmLJ9\">See individual photos and captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We did a lot of sightseeing when we were here a few years go.
