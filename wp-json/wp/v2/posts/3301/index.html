The campground is located right at the dam with great access and views.  There is also a Tailwaters campground below the dam.  We didn&#8217;t get a chance to check it out.<\/p>\n<p>This is a TVA campground, very similar to a Corps of Engineers campground which are favorites of ours.  The campsites have water and 50 amp hookups.  Many of the campsites are large enough for most any camper.  We were in a pull through site on the hill overlooking the lake.  The only negative was that the site sloped left to right.  There are also several beautiful back in sites down close to the water &#8211; I&#8217;d likely try to get one of those on future trips.  Not all sites on the hill will accomodate all rigs, so be sure to pay attention when booking your site.  Aside from size, we thought we would have been happy in most any of the spots we could fit into.<\/p>\n<p>I had no problem getting a satellite signal and our Verizon 4G was good.  We think this campground is a real winner and will happily return on future visits to this beautiful area.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTXMZQ5bk8ID6n9Yq4Jo8SxfqmMMN2NMLBVuYnkcEEifnQSxPkA9klw0KVvBedAw03EMoGWHhifT--e\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/MPaDiMsBqWn3EZRQA\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We really liked it at Douglas Dam Headwater Campground, just north of Sevierville, TN.
