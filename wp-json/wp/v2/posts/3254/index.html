The 50 amp sites in that area don&#8217;t have the $3 a day surcharge that is charged for all the other 50 amp sites in the campground. However, I must confess we got a bit tired of the big hill. For this stay we decided to check out Loop B. We found a great spot and felt we made an excellent choice. About all but the sites in Loop A (which has some very nice spots) are full hookup. Honestly, it isn&#8217;t hard to find a nice campsite in this Thousand Trails.<\/p>\n<p>Every interaction we had with the staff was positive and we appreciated their helpfulness.<\/p>\n<p>My only complaint is the lack of internet connectivity. My Verizon signal was poor leaving me with only a fair data connect. Campground WiFi is only available at the Activity Center and it is even slower \u2013 think old time dial-up speeds. It isn&#8217;t that the campground hasn&#8217;t tried to supply WiFi. The area providers simply aren&#8217;t willing to come out to the campground.<\/p>\n<p>My satellite TV signal was easy to dial in. There are many interesting things to see and do in the area as well as a nice pool and other facilities right on the property. Lots of shopping and restaurants are within 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy to see why Hershey Thousand Trails is one of the most popular campgrounds in the system. We are already thinking about our next visit.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTYD2XL_AneINHwofnbBpG-y9klgUyfKOxBKcng27BeL3KxMlDjoUJJJ77bpkMDbCcZu7tevlSFnbHj\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/zeMAwdfCDCZZdPQZ6\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were looking forward to this two week stop at Hershey, PA Thousand Trails and it didn&#8217;t disappoint.
