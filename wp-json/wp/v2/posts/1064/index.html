It&#8217;s also about 60 miles south of the Grand Canyon. Both the I40 and the Grand Canyon proximity made Canyon Gateway RV Park in Williams, AZ a good shortstop for us. Admittedly, there&#8217;s some traffic noise off the Interstate but we didn&#8217;t find it to be especially objectionable. They are building a truck stop adjacent to the campground, so in the future being sandwiched between the highway less than a mile away on one side and the truck stop on the other noise may become an issue.<\/p>\n<p>Still, I see this as a good spot for a short stay. The sites are level with full hookups. The restrooms and showers were very clean and the campground offers decent WiFi and even a few channels of cable TV. In addition to the mega attraction of the Grand Canyon being an hour away, downtown Williams is a fun place to visit. After a stroll up and down the main street we especially enjoyed our meal at the Pine Country Restaurant and recommend it. Williams also is where the Grand Canyon Railroad begins. This RV Park doesn&#8217;t pretend to be a destination, but it works well for travelers as well as folks who want to spend a day at one of our nation&#8217;s most visited, and beautiful, national parks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos This RV Park is a couple of minutes from I40; a good spot for those traveling and in need of a place to land for the night.
