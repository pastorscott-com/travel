We were here a year and a half ago and I did a review of this campground then. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2015\/10\/11\/campground-review-indian-lakes-thousand-trails-batesville-in\/\">You can see it here.<\/a> Really, things are pretty much the same now as they were then so there\u2019s no need to do another major review. I will mention that we were happy to get a spot in Phase 4 again. It isn\u2019t as easy to get into this popular section as it was because more campsites have been taken over by seasonal residents. We\u2019ve been here 2 weeks and we have yet to see anyone at some of the campers around us. Beyond that, it\u2019s my impression that over the weekends that all the full hookup sites in the campground were taken. However, this is such a big place that I doubt it ever gets completely full. We\u2019ve enjoyed mostly good weather, had no problem getting our satellite TV, had a good Verizon signal, and, in general, had a pleasant stay. We give this Thousand Trails a \u201cthumbs up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRo9JAEPBvJQufQ9PwT9GWH67_YauOX5QUhX7P7fItqA3MjM6MlLrsKf9ay0FUaoU5zefLCNeEcSvvJ\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re just finishing up our second stay at Indian Lakes Thousand Trails in Batesville, Indiana.
