The August heat was intense and that kept us inside more than we would have liked.  However, there was a bit of a reprieve in the mornings and evenings.  We took advantage of that to get some walks in and to sit outside and enjoy our morning coffee.  <\/p>\n<p>The virus has limited activities at Lake Texoma as it has most everywhere.  However, the pools are open.  They received plenty of action, especially over Labor Day weekend.  I was a bit surprised to see several nice sites unused over the holiday.  I&#8217;m guessing it was the result of unseasonably hot weather plus the virus concerns.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve reviewed this Thousand Trails before, so I&#8217;ll just add a few more photos in this review.  We enjoy this campground and will look forward to staying there again.<\/p>\n<p><center><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/texoma\/\">All Lake Texoma reviews are here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTN-ceIe233PSDW8LaavlKReTNccnMsyi__9BTURSzyEyXbCqPcaFCYt1bcFLxJCDLrkOsfCaiALOhA\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We enjoyed another nice stay at Lake Texoma Thousand Trails, near Gordonville, TX.
