We had some threatening weather early in our stay, mostly buckets of rain with some hail, but then things settled down to a more typical weather pattern that we hope lasts for weeks to come.<\/p>\n<p>Our campsite the past week has been a good one, backed by the the lake just a few steps behind the camper. The lake front spots in this section (section C) are very popular with those with annual sites and I think our spot is the only full hookup site available to travelers like us. All the rest have campers parked on them and some people have fixed their sites up with landscaping, etc. I will mention that there are a few lakeside sites for those who are okay with water\/electric only sites.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of nice shady FHU sites available to travelers in other sections of the campground. I think \u201csection H,\u201d in particular, has some nice sites (just not along the lake). When we arrived we were told that there were repairs being made to the sewer line in that section so we didn\u2019t even look there. Also, because of all the high water \u201csection I\u201d was closed to new arrivals. At that point there was some concern about Lake Tawakoni flooding that section of the campground. And there was some water in that area. The lake, within just a couple of weeks went from being down a third to being filled and slightly over full with water running over the dam for the first time in years.<\/p>\n<p>The campground boasts both a nice Family Activity Center with it\u2019s own pool, small basketball court, and mini-golf and an Adult Activity Center with it\u2019s own pool. There\u2019s also a small marina for those with their own boats.<\/p>\n<p>Our Verizon had a couple of usable bars of 4G and I was able to get 2 of the 3 Dish Network satellites which gave us most of our TV channels, although not all in HD. There are no 50 amp electrical sites in the facility but there are plenty of FHU sites. Thousand Trails is notorious for bad roads and this place is no exception. In this case, it starts before you arrive as County Road 1470 into the campground is just as bad as any of the roads in it.<\/p>\n<p>GWe especially enjoyed the beautiful sunsets over the lake. This Thousand Trails is a reasonably short drive from both I30 and I20 \u2013 about an hour east of Dallas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff We\u2019ll have good memories of Lake Tawakoni Thousand Trails, just east of Dallas, because it was during our stay here that the horrible storms of the memorable Texas spring of 2015 finally came to an end.
