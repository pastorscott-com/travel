The park is just minutes from the ferry docks and downtown St Ignace and near the northern end of Mackinaw Bridge. There are a variety of campsites, ranging from full hookup, 50 amp, pull-throughs down to tent sites nestled in the woods. Most of the sites are gravel, although there is a popular no-sewer, grassy area near the restrooms. Many, but not all, of the back in sites have grassy strips between the campsites but the pull-throughs are a generally a bit tighter. We were given an \u201cend site\u201d that resulted in our having a larger front yard. Our neighbor to the driver\u2019s side, though, was faced in the opposite direction of us and was within just a few feet of us.<\/p>\n<p>The interior roads are all good gravel and the sites are fairly level with the exception of a few that would be challenging. Lake Huron is easily visible from the road in front of the campground entrance but only a very few campsites would offer any sort of lake view at all.<\/p>\n<p>There are some big trees in the campground but we were able to get satellite TV after moving the dish around some to find a \u201chole in the sky.\u201d My 4G Verizon was pretty good and the campground WiFi was solid. The restrooms were kept reasonably clean and there are individual shower rooms as well as a laundry on site.<\/p>\n<p>They honor Passport America, Escapees, and other discounts and I was allowed to combine them, giving me a nice discount for 6 of the 7 nights we stayed. Obviously, the discounts offered, plus the location results in lots of overnight visitors who are just passing through. I don\u2019t think we would have done any better for the price at any campground in the area.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff Tiki RV Park is in St Ignace, MI \u2013 a primary launching point for visits to Mackinac Island.
