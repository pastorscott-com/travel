It seems that propane, carbon monoxide, and smoke detectors are all programmed to die or at least run out of battery somewhere between 2:00 and 5:00 AM &#8211; at least that&#8217;s been our experience!<\/p>\n<p>Seriously, we change out the batteries on schedule and seldom have that happen.  However, the propane detector is wired into the RV batteries so it is generally out of sight and out of mind.  That&#8217;s my motivation for writing about this now: since the propane detector is wired in it doesn&#8217;t start chirping due to batteries dieing it&#8217;s easily taken for granted.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; these vital safety devices have a limited lifespan.  Depending on who you ask they are intended to last 3-7 years.  Ours was about 10 years old and it still tested okay when we thought to check it or set it off accidentally when cleaning next to it. That is until around 5:00 this morning.  <\/p>\n<p>I got up, pulled the ground wire off of it so it would be quiet and closed the propane tank valves just to be safe.  Today we headed out to the RV supply store and bought the replacement.  They aren&#8217;t cheap by any means and if yours is nearing the end of life you might want to shop online and save some money.  <\/p>\n<p>In our case, it seemed wise to spend the extra money, support the local supplier, and get the replacement.  Swapping the units out took all of 3 minutes.  If you haven&#8217;t checked your safety devices in a while this might be a good day to do it&#8230;and don&#8217;t forget the easily forgotten hard-wired propane detection alarm.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About 5:00 AM today we woke up to our propane alarm going off.
