Eight years ago our dear friends at Alvin, TX Church of the Nazarene gave us a terrific retirement party on Sunday, and then, on Monday we began our RV life.  During these years we have traveled the USA coast to coast.  We&#8217;ve met many nice people and made some great friends.  We have also taken time out from traveling to fill in at various churches that were in pastoral transition.  Again, we have made many wonderful friends and enjoyed being of service in those churches.  This year we are hanging out in the Houston area getting ready to celebrate our granddaughter&#8217;s high school graduation.  After that, we will begin our 2021 Adventure.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re celebrating the 8th anniversary of my retirement and our beginning the fulltime RV lifestyle!
