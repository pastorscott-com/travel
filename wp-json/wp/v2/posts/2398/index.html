Honestly, there\u2019s still more to see.<\/p>\n<p>The Mall of America lived up to its reviews. We were here a few years ago but this time we covered all the floors. I had read about the new Crayola store. We made that our first stop. There is every color of crayon and marker available there. One entire wall from floor to ceiling was filled with crayons and markers. A person could choose a box or basket and fill it with your choice of crayon or marker and pay for them at check-out. There are toys, jewelry, stuffed animals coloring books for all ages, as well as clothing. A really fun place to see. As we walked we found stores offering everything you have seen in any mall. Along with the stores the mall offers an Indoor amusement park with rollercoasters and other rides. We saw a water ride, a mini golf course and the aquarium. After walking all four floors and doing a little shopping we headed home.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond all the sightseeing, we enjoyed the cooler summer weather, especially during the later part of our stay.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQEqPBP4ltPKdsiAiGJDHzI3f4E0Es4ECVuo7WnkPHbg_WlDhq3KYNlrgPZ9SD6DhkA1uADRQYsJmI3\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a lot to see in the Twin Cities and we enjoyed our sightseeing.
