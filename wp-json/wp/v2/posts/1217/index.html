Of course, it\u2019s a big deal financially so it\u2019s mostly been something to talk about while not really expecting to do it.&nbsp; A few months ago we talked about it a bit more seriously.&nbsp; We know that retirement may not be real soon, but it is lurking out there.&nbsp; We know we won\u2019t be able to afford such a trip as retirees so, in some ways it is now or never.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve kept an eye on airfares and they were always too high.&nbsp; We\u2019d pretty much given up on the trip for this year, hoping airfares would drop before our eventual retirement.&nbsp; Still, I\u2019ve kept an eye on fares, and a few months ago, I happened to think of it and checked.&nbsp; To my surprise they had dropped by quite a bit.&nbsp; It was still hard to commit to such a trip, but, after thinking about it a few days we decided to go for it.&nbsp; The next day, the airfares went right back up and never came down again.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

We flew British Airways \u2013 economy class.&nbsp; It wasn\u2019t bad, although it would, of course, be nice to sit up front in one of the fancy seats.&nbsp; The flight leaves at 4:20pm Houston time, but it\u2019s already 10:20pm in London.&nbsp; If the traveler can trick their body into sleeping on the flight it\u2019s a very good thing.&nbsp; Both Jackie and I got some sleep \u2013 or at least we dozed a bit.&nbsp; Still when the flight arrived at 7:00am local time, our bodies thought it was 1:00am.&nbsp; A six hour time difference is nothing to sneeze at!<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/09\/2011-london-9-26-2011-12-15-03-AM.jpg\" style=\"clear: left;
