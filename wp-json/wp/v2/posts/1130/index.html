If you are looking for a quiet, pastoral campground this is it. Really, it\u2019s hard to believe that the hustle and bustle of the interstate is only 10 minutes away. The grounds are fairly wide open with a several oak and pecan trees that provide some nice shade. We liked the fact that the property is all mowed and not overgrown.<\/p>\n<p>There are two RV areas. Section A is closest to the entrance and near the small pool and hot tub. The pool isn\u2019t heated but the hot tub is inside a small building. Sections C and D are closer to the river and also have a nice playground. You can see the river only from a few sites and river access is via a small, and little used, boat ramp at the corner of the campground.<\/p>\n<p>The campground offers a wide variety of RV site options ranging from water\/electric only to full hookup\/50 amp sites. You\u2019ll want to pay attention to the campground map as you select your site because the site across the road or even right next to the one you are looking like may offer different amenities: 50 or 30 amp, no sewer hookup, etc. I think the only two pull through sites are water\/electric only.<\/p>\n<p>The roads in the campground are in poor repair and for some reason this year the area is suffering a bumper crop of grass stickers. There\u2019s no telling how many of them we\u2019ve picked out of our camper\u2019s carpet!<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve enjoyed hearing the coyotes and watching armadillos and many deer. The campground has a &#8220;no feeding&#8221; policy so while the deer aren&#8217;t especially afraid of people they do want to keep their distance. We also took advantage of the many pecan trees, picking up pecans for future use. By the way, if you are in the campground in the fall, check out the tangerine tree near the Activity Center. We picked a few of those too.<\/p>\n<p>We liked it at Colorado River Thousand Trails and look forward to future visits to this easy going campground.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff Colorado River Thousand Trails is just outside Columbus, TX a few minutes drive north of I10.
