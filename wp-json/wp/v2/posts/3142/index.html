The campground was a nice base of operations for our exploring and I think the best thing about Rondout Valley is its location.  While most attractions aren&#8217;t exactly close, they are nearby.   The campground, itself, has a big pool that stays quite busy.  There&#8217;s an Activity building with a caf\u00e9, a rather worn Adult Lodge, a camp store, and a few sports venues.  We saw many children having a wonderful time biking the roads and enjoying all the campground has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Rondout Valley has many seasonal and permanent campers.  That does limit the number of sites available for others, but, from what I could tell there were a few vacant spots available most of our stay.  The big rigs prefer the spots along the main road in.  These are 50 amp\/FHU sites.  Those on the north side of the road have a chance at getting satellite TV.  The sites are plenty deep, but are pretty close side to side.  There are also 30 amp\/FHU sites that would work for bigger rigs.  Really, things are spread out to the point that I&#8217;m not sure I got a handle on what sites are where.<\/p>\n<p>The main roads in and around the campground are nicely paved.  Other roads are gravel with potholes.  The restrooms are older and often in need of attention, especially over the weekend when the place was packed out.  If anything, I&#8217;d say this campground is being loved to death and that leaves an overall feeling of it being too well used.<\/p>\n<p>Overall we liked it at Rondout Valley.  I often say that, like real estate, how I feel about a campground is all about location, location, location.  In this case, we got a nice back-in site with our preferred hookups.  I was able to get satellite TV without any problem and my Verizon data was solid.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTg4PaTqMqJebvK1on5lRPDXF41XBnjW_bwf_MMUEWWUD-7jDtFmx-364XV5dgQ-6OjgCPGj1mQCnX3\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/3un9gj71tAf6hKYg6\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a> <\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We didn&#8217;t come close to seeing all the attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Rondout Valley Thousand Trails, located near Accord, New York.
