We were last here in May, 2013 and the campground is about the same as it was then. We appreciated the ranger giving us a list of vacant full hookup, 50 Amp sites that were available, I think there were 8 or 9. We picked the one that looked good to us and settled into a large, level, gravel site. There\u2019s a $3 a night surcharge for 50 Amps \u2013 in fact, the power pedestals for those sites are padlocked until the surcharge is paid. This Thousand Trails has both a large \u201cfamily\u201d pool and Activity Center and a smaller Adult pool with spa and Adult Activity Center. There are many annual campsites that have been improved in various ways by the residents. A surprising number of the residents light their sites at night with \u201crunning lights\u201d whether or not they are present. However, if a person arrives looking for a 30 Amp full hookup site they would have many nice spots from which to choose. The roads in the campground are typical Thousand Trails: read rough and pothole filled.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/texoma\/\">All Lake Texoma Thousand Trails reviews are here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We had no problem getting a satellite signal and our Verizon signal was a solid 4G.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft \" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-oUDdlR-n6Tg\/WcqO6AirIlI\/AAAAAAAAut8\/FULV8zJg4wQn11FnefdXlmZidQNBw1wkACCoYBhgL\/s0\/20170925_094859.jpg\" width=\"311\" height=\"175\" \/>Our arrival day at Lake Texoma was a difficult travel day for us in which a tire on the pickup came apart, doing considerable damage to the pickup. As a result the pickup was in need of repairs and we needed to travel to Houston to pick up our car so we would have transportation during the repairs. The campground management worked with us as we dealt with these unexpected, unwelcome circumstances. We did shorten our stay by a few days as we needed to time our relocation days with the repairs.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft \" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/-sRrOYCTUKX0\/WgOeWIr9CDI\/AAAAAAAAvho\/hqmA9Y8J-pcOAMNpZRJX-DWLlhzzSNKtwCCoYBhgL\/s0\/20170921_104144.jpg\" width=\"279\" height=\"157\" \/><br \/>\nOne strange coincidence is that the last time we visited Lake Texoma Thousand Trails we had a tire begin to delaminate as we traveled. We had to stop and buy two new tires. Here we are four years later and, as we traveled to the campground we had a tire (likely one of those bought on that day in 2013) come apart, forcing us to stop and buy four new tires. It almost makes us afraid to schedule Lake Texoma Thousand Trails again!<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTwBx8T3GmM5gOr5mg8MMH3tV_BaIcZEnfuePeTIMKHrBpLRdJZZBKqqgcVNoN2D9BYb3jxiZJlcAeQ\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/LUjta007PsqUAH7i1\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In spite of Texas late September summer-like temperatures, we enjoyed our stay at Lake Texoma Thousand Trails, Gordonville, TX.
