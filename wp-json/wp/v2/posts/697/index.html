not to mention that walking around in a motorhome in motion is somewhat dangerous and likely illegal.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t had to set up in any downpours, and if we did, we\u2019d just get a little wet moving from the pickup to the camper where we\u2019d wait it out.\u00a0 Also, we don\u2019t do camp Walmart or stay in rest areas so the possibility of needing to make a run for it from some undesirable situation really isn\u2019t that great.<\/p>\n<p>Then, we\u2019ve had the pickup in the shop three times now, once overnight.\u00a0 It was nice not having to take our whole house in to the shop and vacate it just for new radiator hoses!<\/p>\n<p>Maybe, someday, we\u2019ll join the motorhome crowd.\u00a0 When we do, we\u2019ll enjoy some of the advantages of living and traveling in a motorhome.\u00a0 At the same time, though, I think we\u2019ll miss some of the pluses of our 5<sup>th<\/sup> wheel.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The sure-fired, guaranteed, spirited discussion topic among fulltiming RVers is, well you know what it is: which is best for fulltiming, motorhome or 5th wheel.\u00a0 The obvious thing is that both are quite suitable.\u00a0 After all, there are thousands upon thousands of people happily and enthusiastically traveling and living in both.
