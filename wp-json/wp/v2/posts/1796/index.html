We spent five hours walking and looking and still didn\u2019t see every exhibit. The museum focuses on the history of the automobile and its impact on history. There are race cars and famous Presidential limousines, classic cars and experimental models that never reached production. Other types of transportation such as stagecoaches, early horse carriages, trains, early gasoline delivery trucks, and airplanes are also on exhibit. They even have early RVs, hotel rooms, signs from food chains, an operating diner, and many other interesting artifacts from American History. We were tempted to return another day to see Greenfield Village (a living history village) or take the factory tour. We decided to save them for a future visit to the area. You can actually buy combined tickets, but honestly, just seeing the museum takes a full, exhausting day.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to visiting the museum we enjoyed time in nearby in Port Huron where we visited the Great Lakes Maritime Center.  It is an excellent place to watch large ships on the St. Clair River. The Blue Water River Walk there is a popular walking and bike path. I was very pleased to see another Little Free Library on the walking trail making books easily available to everyone.  I also recommend the Blue Water trolley as a fun way to see the primary sites of Port Huron \u2013 with a fare of just ten cents you can\u2019t go wrong!  Just to the south of Port Huron is St. Clair which is another great place to walk a nice boardwalk and enjoy the river.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR5alwgne1eK1uZBB1NzRoyY1uGEMw9OK24tU3XuGmNiIFvFX-z2L2__REf04_m2iPRnTVgRC6yw13E\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our primary sightseeing attraction during our stay near St. Clair, MI was a fun day at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn.
