Our lifestyle as fulltimers is shorter moves and longer stays. When we were vacationers we did the opposite: longer moves and shorter stays. However, there are always exceptions so once in a while we do a &#8220;shortstop&#8221; of just a night or two. In this case we&#8217;re taking our Hitchhiker to its birthplace in Chanute, KS for some long overdue repairs and just needed a spot to land for the night.\u00a0 One plus for us is that we have some long time friends in Tulsa and we enjoyed some time with them.<\/p>\n<p>All of that to say we did a one night stop in Tulsa at Warrior RV park. Really, it&#8217;s a nice place for a short stay; located right on I44 and near Hwy 75. This is an older park, mostly pull-throughs. Our site was barely long enough for pickup and hooked up camper. All the connections are at the back of the site so I had to get out an extra water hose and add a sewer hose connection. The water connect is underground. I had to get down on my knees to connect the water hose.<\/p>\n<p>The owners are friendly and accomodating. I asked about parking and they directed me to some nearby sites that they didn&#8217;t expect to use and told me that any of them are fine. They also offered to help me hook up the water if I was having trouble getting to the spigot. Yes, you can hear the traffic, but when you pick an RV park beside an interstate you can&#8217;t expect much else. The restrooms are older. When we were there they needed cleaning, but it looked like the need was the result of recent activity.\u00a0 Our Verizon signal was good, campground WiFi worked fine, and I had no problem getting a satellite TV signal.<\/p>\n<p>If you are visiting Tulsa and need a spot or traveling across Oklahoma and just want a stop for a night or two, this is a good place to land.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vT3OhLCXrmC4me9OrJ5WAUdIGF7uqnauYGnKGSHZgNKvGc7S_4NQBLx4IKysB4_tmWmkyWY2MqhBwNw\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/6gSUAPzcs49zeZSM8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See individual photos with notes here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We don&#8217;t do many one night stops.
