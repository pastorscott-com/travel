Many fulltimers tell me they have a blog, and if they do, I bookmark their site intending to keep up with them. To be honest, I tend to forget those bookmarked sites and seldom look at them.<\/p>\n<p>Tonight, something brought those blogs to mind and I decided to check in on those folks we&#8217;ve meet along the way.<\/p>\n<p>To my surprise many of them have left the road. As far as I can tell, the lifestyle changes were pretty much voluntary although I know of a few folks who have had health issues that forced a change of lifestyle (<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2015\/02\/21\/just-thinking-for-those-who-dream-of-going-fulltime-in-a-rv\/\">I wrote about that here<\/a>). The others, I think, just came to a &#8220;been there done that&#8221; time in life and decided to find a place to land and start a new chapter in their lives.<\/p>\n<p>While I was surprised at the number of fulltime RVers we&#8217;ve met that are no longer traveling it comes as no surprise that things change. In fact, as someone has wisely said, change is the one constant in life.<\/p>\n<p>It is, though, good to be reminded that as enjoyable as fulltiming is, for most of us it&#8217;s an all too brief passage of life. Hopefully, for us, the adventure will end because we done all we wanted to do and are ready for a different sort of adventure. There&#8217;s a pretty good chance though, that it will involve something less voluntary.<\/p>\n<p>I guess the point of this philosophic rambling is a reminder that the fulltime lifestyle, as enjoyable as it is, is a temporary passage in life. We don&#8217;t want to take this blessing for granted and we don&#8217;t want to get sidetracked from it by anything that doesn&#8217;t measure up, although it is reasonable to be reminded that some things do measure up and can make an unexpected appearance at any time (<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2016\/04\/24\/2016-a-different-sort-of-adventure\/\">we&#8217;ve had that happen once<\/a>). As it is, though, this chapter will end soon enough. Whether we have a short or long time to go in this adventure we want to make every day count.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we&#8217;ve enjoyed the fulltime lifestyle we&#8217;ve met some interesting people.
