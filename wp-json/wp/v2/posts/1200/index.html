a budget for our London\/Paris trip"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>As we began planning our trip to London and Paris I created an Excel spreadsheet to use in estimating our expenses.\u00a0 I created lines for each day of the trip, including what we intended to do that day.\u00a0 Then I added columns for the entry of various types of expenditures.\u00a0 Some were prepaid: Travel, Lodging, and a couple of Sightseeing items.\u00a0 They were charged to the credit card and were paid before we ever left home.\u00a0 Other columns listed items with amounts I either had researched or were just educated guesses: Food, Travel (local), and Sightseeing (again).\u00a0 I filled in these amounts the best I could.<\/p>\n<p>All told, then, I had a budget for our trip.<\/p>\n<p>During the trip we used a debit card to get cash and only used the credit card for our final night\u2019s lodging.\u00a0 We carried cash (plus a little) for each day and paid for everything as we went.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t bother to hang on to receipts for things paid for by cash.\u00a0 Of course, we knew how much we had withdrawn with the debit card, so we knew where we were so far as the big picture was concerned.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, I knew I\u2019d taken, say, $500 cash with the debit card, so when I was running out of money I knew we\u2019d spent $500 \u2013 I just didn\u2019t bother trying to keep up with how much we\u2019d spent on food or on public transportation or sightseeing.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve just finished revisiting the spreadsheet, now working with actual dollar amounts.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line: we spent $55.39 more than I budgeted!<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, my research and educated guesses were pretty good.\u00a0 One thing, I think, that kept us on track was that we planned to put about as much effort into each day as we could physically do so there wasn\u2019t much chance that we\u2019d suddenly decide to visit an extra attraction.\u00a0 Our plate was full enough as it was.\u00a0 Speaking of \u201cplates\u201d \u2013 the food budget would have been the easiest one to blow.\u00a0 Since we were in an apartment most of the time we planned to eat pretty much what we always eat for breakfast.\u00a0 We then planned on having a light (sandwich type) lunch each day and then eat out that evening unless we just wanted to hang out at the apartment and fix something easy for supper.\u00a0 We did that a few times, but also enjoyed some good meals in the nearby restaurants.\u00a0 Let me add that we generally like finding places where the locals eat rather than going to a more up-scale restaurant.\u00a0 One person could have spent our entire day\u2019s food budget in a lot of very nice establishments.\u00a0 I\u2019m not against that, but that\u2019s just not our thing.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, if a person spends some time looking into things and is realistic, there\u2019s a good chance that they can set a trip budget and stick to it.<\/p>\n<p>At least, let\u2019s say, missing it by no more than $55.39.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we began planning our trip to London and Paris I created an Excel spreadsheet to use in
