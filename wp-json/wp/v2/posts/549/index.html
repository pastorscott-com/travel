although we are planning on taking a month off somewhere along the line and head south for warmer temperatures and a change of venue&#8230;just because we can!<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few random observations drawn from the past months of travel:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>I like planning and organizing.\u00a0 Some fulltimers detest it.\u00a0 They want to hit the road in the morning not knowing where they will be that evening.\u00a0 If they are driving along and see something interesting along the way they change directions and follow their nose.\u00a0 That doesn&#8217;t suit us.\u00a0 We like looking at the map, planning the best route and knowing there will be a spot for us when we land at the end of the day.\u00a0 For budgeting purposes, I had planned our entire summer, at least in theory, before we left Conroe.\u00a0 With only a few changes, we followed that route and schedule all the way.\u00a0 We liked doing it that way and we&#8217;ll probably continue that practice in the future.<\/li>\n<li>We like stays of longer than a week, but not as long as two weeks.\u00a0 My rule of thumb is that, as fulltimers, we are going to spend every night somewhere.\u00a0 For us, the journey is the destination so we are in no hurry.\u00a0 At the same time, we are out on the road to see things we wouldn&#8217;t see otherwise.\u00a0 The occasional one week stay was fine, but having to button down the camper and move every week, we realized, could become a bit of a drag.\u00a0 At the same time, we had some longer stays in places where it didn&#8217;t take long to see all there was to see.\u00a0 For those I mentioned above, it is easy to just move on.\u00a0 For us, with reservations already made, we needed to stay put.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve decided that, aside from nights when we are simply &#8220;in route&#8221; that we like stops of 10 or 11 days.<\/li>\n<li>The most dangerous time for any RVer is arriving at a campground.\u00a0 As you arrive you are a bit tired and you are now off the highway and needing to maneuver campground roads.\u00a0 You are looking at campsites and trying to take it all in, and, then you are landing the big rig.\u00a0 There are tree limbs and power pedestals and ditches.\u00a0\u00a0 All this combines to increase the likelihood that something bad will happen.\u00a0 Another of my new found rules of thumb is this: don&#8217;t let anyone talk you into trying to park the camper in a spot where you are uncomfortable.\u00a0 This applies to pick-your-own-site and assigned site campgrounds.\u00a0 Even if &#8220;people park campers as big as yours in that spot all the time&#8221; don&#8217;t do it if you have doubts.\u00a0 After all, when something bad happens, it will be you who will pay for the damage, not the campground.\u00a0 Happily, I learned the lesson without paying the price &#8211; but I came close; not once, but three times, and in the same campground!<\/li>\n<li>When picking a campsite, take your time.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t think you have to take the first spot you come to.\u00a0 Find a pull through site where you can leave the rig and take a quick walk around the campground.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve learned to keep an eye out for the location of the dumpsters in relation to the campsite.\u00a0 Who wants to listen to the lid of one of those things bang all day?\u00a0 We&#8217;ve also learned to take the slide outs into consideration before backing in.\u00a0 A tight fit becomes no fit at all if the slide will hit the power pedestal when extended. \u00a0 If it fits it fits, even if it&#8217;s a tight fit.\u00a0 If it doesn&#8217;t, well, it doesn&#8217;t.\u00a0 It&#8217;s good to know that before you fight your way into the site.\u00a0 We&#8217;re still learning this one: unless you like a nice bright campsite, it&#8217;s wise to notice where the street lights are.\u00a0 We like to sit out and enjoy our portable campfire and watch the stars.\u00a0 Twice now, as darkness fell, we realized the campsite was flooded with light.<\/li>\n<li>Let me provide a spiritual dimension to all this.\u00a0 For years Jackie and I have stopped just prior to leaving on trips to bow our heads and ask the Lord&#8217;s protection for our journeys.\u00a0 We have carried that practice into our RV adventure.\u00a0 Each move has started with a prayer of thanksgiving for our stay and petition for a safe, enjoyable journey.\u00a0 The Bible tells us that if we acknowledge the Lord in our lives that he will direct our ways (Proverbs 3:6).\u00a0 We have taken that word of instruction to heart.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In May, after spending a week at Lake Conroe, TX Thousand Trails we hitched the camper to the pickup and headed north on I45 to begin what we&#8217;ve called our &#8220;summer of 2013 adventure.&#8221;\u00a0 On the first of November, after six months of travel, we arrived back at Lake Conroe completing our big circle and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[4,18,22,49,50,101],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/549"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=549"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/549\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5465,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/549\/revisions\/5465"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=549"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=549"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=549"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
