The campground is pretty much flat and open, but if you look around a bit you&#8217;ll note that the residents have gyrated to the sites that offer a bit of afternoon shade. Again, this is a big campground so most everyone should be able to find a suitable spot in spite of the &#8220;red dots&#8221; and the annuals. If you don&#8217;t need 50 amps and don&#8217;t mind being a bit of a distance away from the main activity center you might want to look at the area nearer the small adult pool and adult lodge. There&#8217;s a section there with some big, shady trees and you would pretty much have the adult pool to yourself.<\/p>\n<p>The staff is friendly and helpful. We were able to get Verizon 4G and satellite TV. It&#8217;s hard to believe that the coast with all it&#8217;s hustle and bustle (and Pacific beauty) is only 25 miles away over the mountain (and 60 miles away by highway). All in all, we like this place and hope to return.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Also, there are plenty of annual residents in the campground.
