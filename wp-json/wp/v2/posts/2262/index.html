We worshiped with these fine folks the past month and enjoyed it very much. Pastor Melissa and her congregation made us feel right at home and I recommend this church to any who visit Escapees Rainbow Plantation.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTie_cKp9dVRKGtgz3DHCA4U5MqvJcXyffGl9Ztf8htDA-IUeJEBeS8frZMkx3vmv6EnV2k_ss8OgR6\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The RV area is grassy on packed sand.
