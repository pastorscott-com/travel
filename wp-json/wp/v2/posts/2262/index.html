The Escapees club is the largest (maybe only) organization for fulltime RVers so when we are at an Escapees park we enjoy the company of like-minded people. This campground, being in the sunny south and in such an interesting area, attracts lots of folks who maybe aren\u2019t RVing fulltime but are at least \u201clong-timers\u201d who spend the winters as \u201cescapees\u201d from the cold north. Everyone is friendly and welcoming and there are lots of walkers who enjoy stopping for a chat.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are there many people in RVs, there is also an entire neighborhood of houses occupied by folks who have \u201cretired\u201d from RV travel or at least have decided this would be a good place to put down some roots. There are a variety of houses but nearly all of them have some kind of accommodation for a RV. It\u2019s fun to walk around and see all the innovative ways people have built houses that also provide for RV parking and use.<\/p>\n<p>The RV area is grassy on packed sand. We enjoyed the spacious site and a nice shady oak tree. In the past we have parked under oak trees in the fall and didn&#8217;t enjoy the acorn bombardment on the camper. This being spring we mainly had to put up with leaves falling (the oaks don&#8217;t shed leaves until new leaves come in and &#8220;push&#8221; them out).<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of activities in the park&#8217;s activity center: everything from a music group to quilters to a chair &#8220;caning&#8221; group. Of course, there are plenty of eating opportunities as well.<\/p>\n<p>Let me include in this review a special mention of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.robertsdalenazarene.com\/\">Robertsdale Church of the Nazarene<\/a>. We worshiped with these fine folks the past month and enjoyed it very much. Pastor Melissa and her congregation made us feel right at home and I recommend this church to any who visit Escapees Rainbow Plantation.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTie_cKp9dVRKGtgz3DHCA4U5MqvJcXyffGl9Ztf8htDA-IUeJEBeS8frZMkx3vmv6EnV2k_ss8OgR6\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We really like this campground.
