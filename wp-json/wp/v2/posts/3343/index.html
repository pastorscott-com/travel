This is a terrific Corps of Engineers campground located along the Arkansas River in the Little Rock metro. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018\/10\/21\/2018-maumelle-coe-campground-little-rock-az\/\">I reviewed the campground on our previous visit<\/a> and I think everything I said then still applies now.<\/p>\n<p>The campsites away from the river are great sites. The ones along the river are, well, excellent. Most of them are 50 amp, paved, back in spots. A few are pull through. Many motorhomes pull in rather than back in so they can enjoy the beautiful river view. A good rule of thumb when reserving is that the riverfront sites on the western end of the campground have their river view blocked by a big marina. Those on the eastern end are 30 amp only. And &#8211; unless you are coming in for only a night or two, you will need reservations if you want one of these prime sites.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, I think it would be a challenge to get satellite TV in many of the sites away from the river. To be fair, most of the Little Rock broadcast TV stations towers are very near the campground. Without even raising our TV antenna we got nearly 40 channels! I also got satellite so there was no lack of TV for us. Also, my Verizon 4G signal was a good one.<\/p>\n<p>As you can tell we really like Maumelle and give it a two thumbs up.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQPLqZeao28ybQlQWp1xWPRXHjZmXceCRF8C1WPd3Xowug-ZI_ShHdtieAF328DEuH0coBRhVFAiQRv\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/BZQTbrHYdCEGEGM59\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We had a shorter stay at Little Rock&#8217;s Maumelle CoE Campground in 2015 and looked forward to this return visit.
