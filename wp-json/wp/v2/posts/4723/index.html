We arrived just prior to the record breaking Texas winter storm.  We had lows in the single digits plus snow and ice.  Then, a week later we had the air conditioning running as temps reached a humid 80 degrees.  In addition to the cold weather the campground joined a good part of the state in being without electricity for a day and a half.  We were so thankful for our Onan generator that ran flawlessly.  That and a full tank of propane kept our furnaces running.  We had a heated water hose, but the campground water froze up so that left us relying on on-board water.  However, in spite of our running heat in our wet bay  our on-board water pump froze up for a day.  We were prepared with plenty of water containers filled.  Really, any inconvenience we experienced was minor compared to what others experienced.<\/p>\n<p>Then, almost overnight, we were back in Springtime weather.  The sun came out, power came back on, the water started working and all was well with the world.  We enjoyed sitting outside and taking several walks.  The Lake Conroe sunsets are always a treat.  <\/p>\n<p>We aren&#8217;t always fans of the &#8220;new&#8221; section (called Area B) of the campground.  As I&#8217;ve mentioned before the sites along the wall almost all slant down, away from the wall.  That means that when you level a motorhome the front tires are left dangling and the entry steps are high in the air.  People in 5th wheels end up putting blocks under their landing gear.  Also, some of these sites have rather steep entry ramps.  In other words, we don&#8217;t recommend those sites.  Other sites in that section, though, are very good.  We ended up in a huge, level pull through.  With bad weather coming in we couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better spot.  <\/p>\n<p>One complaint we have is the lack of respect several have for this nicer section of the campground.  I can&#8217;t believe how many people drive up onto the grass, leaving deep ruts.  Frankly, since I was here when some of the landscaping was going on I can&#8217;t believe Thousand Trails allows it.  This section of Lake Conroe Thousand Trails has some of the nicest campsites in the entire system.  It is a shame to see people showing such a lack of appreciation for it.<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, if you are coming to this property I suggest you not have tunnel vision about staying in Area B.  There are many nice sites in other areas.  They are closer to the pool, etc. and in the summer some of them offer a bit of shade.  Over in &#8220;B&#8221; you will have a white concrete site that reflects the sun right back onto your camper.  Anyway, it is a &#8220;to each his own&#8221; situation.  Generally speaking, we have been happy with the choices of campsites in this campground and it remains one of our favorite Thousand Trails.<\/p>\n<p>We have written <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/lake-conroe\/\">several other reviews of this campground &#8211; you can find them here.<\/a> <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSgeATAkhIiBT-31gaCzgmnBp8QOFpkqSSwk6-Dxg9ggf87v9gpC9Tsdo8T0Z84rXMmyqX8noP-kckX\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You might say that our February 2021 stay at Lake Conroe Thousand Trails was a study in contrasts.
