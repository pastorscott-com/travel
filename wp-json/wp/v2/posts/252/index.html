Once the weather cooled, the electric settled down.\u00a0 Word is that this section is slated for a 50 amp upgrade.\u00a0 One lesson I learned from my arrival here is to never let anyone (even people with the best of intentions) talk you into trying to park in a spot that you feel isn&#8217;t suitable for your rig.\u00a0 They may tell you that &#8220;people park here all the time&#8221; but when you get stuck or manage to damage your rig, it will be you who pays for the repairs.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a small camper you&#8217;ll love coming to this resort.\u00a0 If you have a bigger one, try to arrive on Sunday-Wednesday when there are plenty of campsites, then, in the overnight area, head for the first two roads up from the lake for the best chances of getting a site you can get in to and that will be somewhat level.\u00a0 The farther up the hill you go, the harder it will be to find a spot.<\/p>\n<p>Would I return?\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 That is, unless I had to arrive during a busy weekend!\u00a0 In that case, I&#8217;d find another place.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I think a couple of issues with the F350 have been fully resolved.\u00a0 The truck had an overheating problem when towing in heavy traffic in Dallas.\u00a0 It had never repeated until the day we came here.\u00a0 As we pulled up a long grade near this campground it overheated again.\u00a0 I took the truck to a nearby Ford dealer and they found that the fan clutch wasn&#8217;t engaging.\u00a0 It is supposed to spin the fan at a much higher speed when towing on a long uphill.\u00a0 The repairs were covered by warranty so, while we were out $100, we didn&#8217;t have to pay the full cost which was several times that amount.\u00a0 Then, as I drove, I felt a familiar shaking of the steering wheel.\u00a0 While on one of our first tows we had a tire tread separate and we ended up buying two new tires.\u00a0 Now one of the remaining two originals (which should have given us at least a year&#8217;s more service) had suffered the same failure.\u00a0 We put the spare on and found matching tires in Buffalo.\u00a0 This time, there was no warranty, so we dropped a big chunk of change on the new tires.\u00a0 Hopefully, we&#8217;ve now solved the biggies and we will get a break (knock on wood) from these kinds of issues for awhile.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re finishing up our time here tomorrow, but the move will be just a few hours to the east.\u00a0 The adventure continues.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Click this for full screen photos See individual photos with captions here.
