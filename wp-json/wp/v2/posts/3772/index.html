Honestly, the stay lasted longer than we originally planned, mostly due to our purchase of the motorhome and car to tow. Green Caye isn&#8217;t a typical RV park for us. Most of the residents here are long term; both retirees and working people. A neighbor told me that most of the people surrounding us have been stationary here many years. There are also long term people who are here for work, staying months to years. While the RV Park has its own area, there are also mobile homes, condos, and rent houses on the same property.<\/p>\n<p>Again, this isn&#8217;t a typical RV park for us. There are no park activities and the only amenity is a new pool which is actually quite a distance from the campground. There is also a convenience store on the property.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of major changes to the park since our last visit are the removal of WiFi from the campground and the closing of the adjacent par 3 golf course. The golf course is now fenced off for cattle. However, there is a nice walking path around the edge of the old golf course.<\/p>\n<p>The office is now located at the old golf pro-shop. One nice feature is the ability to receive packages. When you receive mail, you get a text or email with a code in it. Using that code you can retrieve the package even when the office is closed.<\/p>\n<p>The property as a whole is well cared for and most sites are pretty good. However, people are allowed to build decks, fences, etc. A few sites and RVs are rather unkempt. There is an active grounds crew that keeps the grass mowed, trash picked up, and any needed repairs done.<\/p>\n<p>The sites are all concrete and the roads are good. We think the best spots are in the four cul-de-sacs but most of those sites are full most of the time. Our second favorite spots are those on the south side of the east-west park road.\u00a0 These sites don&#8217;t back up to 20th St E. That road gets a lot of morning and afternoon traffic so it can be rather noisy. Being on the south side of the RV Park road makes a huge difference. There are also a lot of pull through sites. Those spots are long enough but are rather narrow, putting you quite close to the people on either side of you.<\/p>\n<p>The big draw for us is that Green Caye is close to family and friends. It is also in a convenient location for shopping and doctors.\u00a0 If not for that we would probably spend our winters either farther south in Texas where the winters are milder or in some of the other popular RV winter states.<\/p>\n<p>We never know what the future holds, but I imagine we&#8217;ll be back at Green Caye again for a winter stay.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/green-caye\/\">Other Green Caye Reviews are here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSTNSpLpslOMNnjNihFCN99tM7hCTJ-XG7G3r498dAR72fDf-tr4kZQClOuYIYaEYdxq4cYR016BWye\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>Click this for full screen photos<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/Lh2pKe8iLqTf3akY7\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We stayed at Green Caye in Dickinson, Texas before and decided to return for the winter of 2018-19.
