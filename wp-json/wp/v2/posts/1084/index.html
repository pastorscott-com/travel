Jerome was a mining town and across the years it produced over a billion dollars in copper, gold and silver.\u00a0 There were two mines there.\u00a0 The first was the United Verde Mine and the second was the Little Daisy mine which was owned by James Stewart Douglas. We stopped at Jerome State Historic Park and toured the museum in the Douglas Mansion which is built over the Little Daisy Mine.\u00a0 The video of the city of Jerome and the mining industry there was fun and informational. Most of the rooms have city and mining memorabilia but the family library is still set up and the billiard room has a billiard table and a piano that belonged to the family.\u00a0 From the park we continued into Jerome and found the streets are as narrow, steep, and twisting as advertised.\u00a0 There is public parking making it easy for those who want to shop or eat.\u00a0 Many of the original buildings are still in use although some are now private homes. We drove up and through the town to a scenic overlook.\u00a0 It is an exceptional view.\u00a0 From the overlook I looked up the mountain and spotted a trestle from the mining days.<\/p>\n<p>We enjoyed looking around the area and know that there is much more that we didn\u2019t see.\u00a0 Really, though, that\u2019s part of the fun of our touring lifestyle.\u00a0 We plan on returning and will continue our exploration of this area then.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff We enjoyed our time in the Sedona\/Cottonwood\/Jerome, AZ area.\u00a0 To be honest, though, we mostly relaxed at the campground doing a few needed chores.
