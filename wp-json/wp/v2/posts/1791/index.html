It\u2019s a bit off the beaten track, around 11 miles east of I75 and then, once you are east of Essexville, it is a few miles down a county road.  On the map the campground appears to be on Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron, and it is very close to the bay.  However, there\u2019s a large, dense wetlands area that makes the bay pretty much inaccessible except by boat via a canal cut through the wetlands.  There are, though, a couple of nice walking areas, one along the canal that stops short of the bay and another 2-3 mile trail through the wetlands, reaching all the way back to town.  The campground itself is situated between corn fields and the wetlands. <\/p>\n<p>100_4555.JPGThis is a nicely done campground with paved roads and campsites.  All campsites are level full hookup, 50 amp sites with adequate grassy yards providing plenty of elbow room.  Our site was wide enough to give us a paved sitting area under the awning and deep enough that we could park the pickup in front of the 5th wheel. <\/p>\n<p> The water hookups are a bit strange.\u00a0 Four sites share a four hookup water spigot.\u00a0 In our case our water hookup was on the wrong side of the camper and fairly distant from it.\u00a0 I pieced a few spare hoses together to reach it, so no worries.\u00a0 However, I can imagine a person coming in and not having enough hose to reach.\u00a0 It would probably be wise to have some extra hose along.<\/p>\n<p>The campground has good WiFi and a heated bath house.\u00a0 I had good Verizon 4G and was able to get a satellite signal with no problem.\u00a0 A big Krogers and lots of other shopping is nearby.\u00a0 There are several seasonal residents at Finn Road and I can see why they like it.\u00a0 This campground gets a thumbs up from us.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQNbOWRQ4VTEt1CZT8S9Qwp7X6ZhstXP8Sgez8tMwA5vcFma3PsYUlAhMOFutc3DEVcWqCC9Fbis5Oo\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finn Road Campground is a township operated campground near Essexville, MI (which is close to Bay City).
