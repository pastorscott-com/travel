Our stay, though, was pretty good.  <\/p>\n<p>Let me tell you the bad first: narrow roads just wide enough for the motorhome with tight and often un-level campsites.  Because of the considerable differences in site sizes the campground has started saving big rig sized sites for people coming in with bigger rigs.  I can understand people with smaller campers being frustrated by this.  On the other hand if a person with a small popup picks one of the &#8220;big rig&#8221; sites the person who arrives in a larger RV might just be out of luck, reservation or not.  Also, I&#8217;ve been at this long enough to have seen that a bigger campsite isn&#8217;t necessarily a better campsite.  <\/p>\n<p>Still, having done my share of camping in a very small travel trailer I know that it can feel like you are being treated as a second class citizen when the campground personnel directs you to some postage-stamp, sloping campsite.   Frankly, many sites have been taken up with permanent cabins and others are rented out for the season.  If not for that, there would be plenty of campsites from which to pick.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let me tell you the good: there are two nice pools, a nifty mini-golf course, and other decent amenities.  Probably the best thing about Williamsburg Thousand Trails is Williamsburg.  This area is a popular tourism destination and everything from Jamestown Settlement to a huge outlet mall is just minutes away.  <\/p>\n<p>If you have a larger RV and are coming to this Thousand Trails be sure to call a day or two ahead and let them know.  It might help you get a spot you can fit into.  Of course, the key to any Thousand Trails is arriving during the week when there are more spots available.<\/p>\n<p>Our Verizon signal was good and I was able to get satellite TV with no problem.  <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQRlaH-hkNjNSccFHokvmZ9rovwXYAv92JCj6bnMcW5hgwhqq8DOjMX0J9rAuKSaur2Zpn9pc7BRwch\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect at Williamsburg, VA Thousand Trails because of the mixed reviews on the campground.
