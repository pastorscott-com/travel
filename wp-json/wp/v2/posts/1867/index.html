The campsites are terraced along the lake and most of the sites have nice views of the lake \u2013 in fact, many are right along the lake.  The campground is on a finger of land, so driving to it means traveling down some country roads.  The roads are okay, but are rather narrow and hilly.  The sites are mainly water with 50 amp electric although there are some that were obviously designed for tents and smaller campers.  Parking in most every site includes backing up a sometimes steep entry ramp.  Once you get to the top of the paved ramp the sites, themselves, are level gravel.  Several of the site ramps are long enough and steep enough that I wouldn\u2019t want to back my 5th wheel up them for fear that the back bumper of the camper would scrape the paved surface of the ramp.  When you make camping reservations online you can see photos of the individual campsites.  You might want to pay attention to the photos to get an idea of just what it would take to back into the sites.  I had no problem getting satellite TV and my Verizon 4G as weak but usable.  The campground is well cared for and the scenery is great.  We\u2019d be happy to have a longer stay here in the future.  <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vR3jbXUnsRx-IghfLgFhr-8Hm7jElvMEfgXLpms1k8jzMbH4wLjfvLMd5cXqvAYTAm0nG-SQJ8T1o-J\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve enjoyed our short stop at Bailey\u2019s Point CoE Campground on Barren Lake near Glasgow, KY.
