The only &#8220;touristy&#8221; thing we did while there was visit the Elvis Presley Birthplace and Park. There&#8217;s a gift shop, museum, the house where Elvis was born, and the church he attended and sang in as a child. It&#8217;s a nice place to spend an hour or two. Also, we were happy to add to our list of nice soft ice cream places. The &#8220;Dairy Kream&#8221; was busy any time we passed by. Our stay at Tupelo was a relaxing one and we thought our five nights there was about the right length of time for us to enjoy the area and take care of a few day to day things we needed to do.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRhrov53po2E1T-NobJZxzczSUlPhBAqPA9hlFAR4IH9N8XEhaeLM1oD9UT_mN_ApMWeq5jZXJDvMDc\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Arriving at our campground in Tupelo we spent our time relaxing, doing a little shopping, and getting maintenance done on the truck.
