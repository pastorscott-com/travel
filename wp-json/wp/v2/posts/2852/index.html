It is just a few minutes west of I35. We always like the CoE parks and Midway Park CoE is no exception. Most of the sites in this smaller park are back-in, 30 amp, water\/electric sites. Several offer nice views of the lake. Most are shady, with covered picnic tables. There are a few &#8220;double-wide&#8221; sites in which two RVs share a spot that has two electric\/water hookups. Also, a few have fairly steep ramps. I don&#8217;t think we would have drug the back bumper in these, but it would have been close. Most of these sites, though, are very long &#8211; long enough for any RV.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-RwbzEZkf9Xg\/WtjHL466uwI\/AAAAAAAAxCY\/QzejSwAYvPkCdatYhd3YMLj7y6sRUokZQCKgBGAs\/s1600\/IMG_20180412_194534.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-RwbzEZkf9Xg\/WtjHL466uwI\/AAAAAAAAxCY\/QzejSwAYvPkCdatYhd3YMLj7y6sRUokZQCKgBGAs\/s200\/IMG_20180412_194534.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"113\" border=\"0\" data-original-width=\"1600\" data-original-height=\"900\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>There is one row of pull-through, 50 amp, full hookup sites. All of these have covered picnic tables. The sites are a bit closer together but not unreasonably so. Honestly, these aren&#8217;t the best sites in the park. The reason is that they are located along the Highway 6 frontage road. This is a busy expressway with lots of traffic. The road noise is pretty much constant, 24 hours a day. Also, people with really big rigs might want to know that making the turn to drive into these pull-throughs is rather tight.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a small, but nice playground and big boat ramp. The roads are excellent. There are many restaurants and stores within minutes of the campground. Our Verizon had a solid 4G signal and I had no problem getting my TV satellite signal. That might not be true in some of the more wooded sites.<\/p>\n<p>I think we liked the nearby Airport COE campground just a little better than this one, but we would happily return here for a future stay.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQuAphotYD79UFqTi7mBrb1M-UaYluz09lE2r8Sczln7b0hL_zVdSxr21Lohm6XmfxGqNg2-LgCW1bX\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/whOiSpiUpl0vopwI2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See individual photos with notes here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Corps park is on Lake Waco, on the west side of the city of Waco.
