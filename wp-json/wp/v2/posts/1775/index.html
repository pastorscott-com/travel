There\u2019s good shade but we had no problem getting satellite TV.    I can\u2019t say as much for cell and internet.  Our Verizon cell service was zero to very poor at its best.  The bar and grill on the property offers free WiFi and it is dependable but noticeably slow and easily overloaded.  You have to be either inside the building or at least right at the door to use the WiFi.  There\u2019s a playground for the kids and some horseshoe pits but the big attraction is the many 4-wheeler\/snowmobile trails out through the National Forest.  Several of the RVers had 4-wheelers and they headed out every day to explore the area via the many miles of well-used trails.  It looked as if it would be a lot of fun.  In the winter the Lodge hosts snowmobile rallies.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like the cold and snow through the long Upper Peninsula winters but I\u2019d sure like giving that sport a try.  The campground has a heated bathhouse and a small laundry.  The next time we travel in this part of the country I\u2019ll be happy to return.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTFugt0qm1syYBulbrAatoqqhufmGRry5fW-geUkR0UBm2j0SX6DET8NHJ3bTsP7N6GDCbDGobmgNjd\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The campsites are spacious and generally long enough for most any RV and there are a few pull throughs.
