There are many stately homes that were built in the 1800s. Some were part of the Underground Railroad that was active here. The downtown has shops in many buildings from the same era. The Broadway Fountain is a perfect setting for pictures. It has been a Madison landmark since 1886. It was recast in bronze to commemorate the Nation\u2019s Bicentennial in 1976. There is a beautiful park\/walking area along the river with benches where one can relax and watch the river traffic. The bridge across the river to Kentucky also has a walkway and many people walk across the river and back.<\/p>\n<p>Our primary reason for visiting was because Scott was raised in this area and he wanted to revisit places from his growing up years. Madison is his grandmother\u2019s home town and he grew up about 15 miles south and west of the town. He enjoyed driving around the area, reviving old memories.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday we drove to the \u201cAutumn on the River\u201d festival in Bethlehem, IN, close to where Scott grew up. We parked in a clover field and could smell the clover as we got out. There was lots of food and music. We enjoyed some homemade bean soup and cornbread. My favorite event of the Festival was the parade. Although it wasn\u2019t large there was an antique firetruck, restored tractors, and beautiful antique trucks and cars. The American Legion was there with several veterans riding along waving to family and friends. It was fun way to spend a fall southern Indiana day.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRqVCJ8RMYviskhaBtpflZ_OjDesneoyeU3rh17kImLDR6p_YqP9aUGY2JwA2xxJtM0lwi23d8_c0-q\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Madison, Indiana is a lovely town set on the banks of the Ohio River.
