We parked in a clover field and could smell the clover as we got out.  There was lots of food and music.  We enjoyed some homemade bean soup and cornbread.  My favorite event of the Festival was the parade. Although it wasn&#8217;t large there was an antique firetruck, restored tractors, and beautiful antique trucks and cars. The American Legion was there with several veterans riding along waving to family and friends.  It was fun way to spend a fall southern Indiana day. <\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRqVCJ8RMYviskhaBtpflZ_OjDesneoyeU3rh17kImLDR6p_YqP9aUGY2JwA2xxJtM0lwi23d8_c0-q\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Saturday we drove to the \u201cAutumn on the River\u201d festival in Bethlehem, IN, close to where Scott grew up.
