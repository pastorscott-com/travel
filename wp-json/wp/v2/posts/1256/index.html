Since we were all here, we decided to have a Sunday morning service.  Fifteen of us gathered on Sunday morning.  Since it was so hot and humid we opened the double doors to the foyer, brought in chairs, and sat in the foyer for a short service.  We sang songs of praise, and then added \u201c\u2019Till the Storm Passes By.\u201d  The second verse was especially appropriate and some wiped tears as they sang.  I then invited people to share words of praise, and asked that people avoid listing damage, etc, but just share their testimonies of praise and thanksgiving.  Their response was fantastic.  At that point, I asked people to share any information that others might like to know.  Someone told us about a gas station that was open in nearby Santa Fe.  Another gave us a more official estimate as to when electricity will be restored.  I read from Isaiah 43 But now, this is what the LORD says\u2014 he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: &#8220;Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.\u201d  We prayed together and closed with the Doxology.  Some folks, who had plenty to do at home stayed to clean up a bit, but the majority of the work will be done another day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/photos\/101128941131953400860\/albums\/5246367878190115185\">Lots of photos here.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had heard from several of our church folks, many of whom rode out the storm.
