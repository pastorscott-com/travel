We took a driving tour through Pennsylvania\u2019s Elk Country. Our first stop was the Elk Country Visitor Center. To get there we drove State route 555. Although the highway was steep and twisty it was a pleasant day for a drive and we enjoyed seeing the many farms, houses and cabins along the way. Scott said he didn&#8217;t mind the mountain driving as long as he wasn&#8217;t towing the 5th wheel!  We didn\u2019t see any elk until we turned into the Visitors Center and we saw one in the trees along the road. The center itself has wide sidewalks bordering a viewing area. Inside the building there are interactive games and hands-on items that teach about the area and wildlife. Several dioramas display scenes from the wild. There&#8217;s a gift shop with many souvenirs and gift items. Outside we walked down a wide path to an overlook for elk viewing. <\/p>\n<p>Another fun stop was Parker Dam State Park.  We enjoyed seeing the swimming beach and the water running over the dam. Civilian Conservation Corps played a large part in building this park. Although the Lew and Helen Adams CCC Museum wasn\u2019t open we enjoyed seeing a road grader and caterpillar that was used by the Corps.<\/p>\n<p>We also visited Bilger\u2019s Rocks. This unique area of huge rocks and trees has trails winding through them. We had a surprise.  As we were walking Scott suddenly stepped backwards. I knew immediately there was a snake somewhere. Thankfully the snake just wanted to move on which was just fine with me.<\/p>\n<p>This area has so much to offer.  A few years ago we visited the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania.  We thoroughly enjoyed the &#8220;Wilds&#8221; and will look forward to exploring more in the future.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vTNRnoZ7VLiuSemopv--ZwSkQFrJAcaAADWAQiCN-HKwvVVwbBsliG6YUkyL5vORg-OREm56XNjL9xv\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/cznxfECbRpN1bnwS9\">See individual photos with captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The northwestern part of Pennsylvania is called the &#8220;Wilds&#8221; and we enjoyed touring a portion of this beautiful, mountainous country.
