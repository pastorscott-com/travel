We stayed at the campground while we visited Jackie\u2019s brother, Jim, and sister-in-law, Phyllis and most of our days were spent out and about with them.<\/p>\n<p>This is a really big campground and, again, to be honest we didn\u2019t see much of it beyond the section we were in. There are a variety of sites, ranging from just a few 50 amp full hookup sites to several 30 amp full hook up spots to water\/electric to electric only. This facility borders Clinton Lake \u2013 a popular area boating and fishing spot. Nearby is a marina and beach. None of the sites in our area, though, bordered the lake. This place is far enough off the beaten track that travelers don\u2019t often find it. The locals, though, fill it up on summer weekends, often in family groups who know just what spots are their favorites.<\/p>\n<p>The roads are good and the sites are level and spacious. I was under the impression that the electric is an issue. Our power pedestal began acting up and getting hot. One of the campground employees cheerfully changed out the plug and breaker and we were back in business. I had the feeling that it was a common occurrence.<\/p>\n<p>There are a couple of issues you might want to know about. First, the few shower houses with modern facilities are in need of more &#8220;TLC.&#8221; Also, there are several stinky pit toilets supposedly available closer to the campsites. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone using them. Second, my Verizon signal was fair to poor, depending on time of day. Using the signal booster I managed to do most of what I wanted but at times it slowed to a crawl.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, our experience at this campground was a positive one and we will likely return.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQZJkHbwxEkzZO4atDLUvcdowoSrVatXzPa8hT0_kR4hRd8FVzUU87fHVBDI6NkMZBXnOfp4nLUupdM\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Right off let me confess that we didn\u2019t spend a great deal of time at the Clinton Lake Recreation Area campground (near DeWitt, IL).
