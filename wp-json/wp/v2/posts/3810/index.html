The park is part of a big enterprise that also includes a hotel, restaurants, and, of course, a casino.  There is even a casino shuttle that comes to the park making it easy for people to visit those venues.<\/p>\n<p>In our case, we just wanted a decent place to spend a few days before continuing our journey east on I20.  This RV spot worked out just great for us.  This is a busy place with a flow of campers arriving and leaving throughout the day.  Many people land just for the night as they travel cross country.  <\/p>\n<p>There are several nice pull through sites of decent length and reasonable spacing for a commercial park.  The roads are wide and easily maneuvered.  Many of the sites are level enough, but there are several that are on a severe slope; some even leaning off to one side as well as front to back.  Judging from the assignment of sites, it appears that an effort is made to put bigger rigs in the more level sites.  A small single axle travel trailer has a better chance of getting level on some of the sites than a big rig.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an active railroad track that passes near the park, but the trains never sound their horns.  You can hear the train, but it&#8217;s not especially objectionable.<\/p>\n<p>While this is just a shorter stay sort of park we would stay here again in similar circumstances.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQ7PjtjfpWTTbyN7XEvzKYtY9XqjZ4QWAmonJbGHMhFP2yG0tegYxb-92NAZ_7U0Rmn0ZtjQGewOuVl\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we left Louisiana and crossed the mighty Mississippi River, we took the very first Mississippi exit and drove a couple of minutes to Ameristar RV Park.
