The collection includes kites used in WW II and kites from around the world. We saw kites used to train anti-aircraft gunners, a kite to use with emergency rescue equipment and a mail kite used in Alaska so airplanes could get mail without landing.  The beauty and variety of kites from around the world was amazing.  Some of the fighting kites are huge!  There are several videos available to watch about the various kites.<\/p>\n<p>Being here on July 4th was an experience. We knew the city of Long Beach provided a fireworks display that could be seen from the beach by our campground.  We began hearing lots of fireworks being shot off by early afternoon and by the time we went to the beach the crack of fireworks was non-stop.  There were thousands of people shooting off fireworks &#8211; many were big ones, loud, high, and colorful. For about 2 hours we sat and watched fireworks up the beach as far as the eye could see.  The city fireworks were impressive but people kept on shooting off their own all through the show. It was an amazing event.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to see and do here in the southwestern tip of Washington and the northeastern tip of Oregon.  I guess you could say we weren&#8217;t disappointed at all in Cape Disappointment!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSNc77R1Z-23Rn-ZeQ9OPuWDFBWy1f91vCq2eqtYUIdgLQR4GPadvtYq5Isz_nM6scB97knRBt4Kkrs\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We also enjoyed the Kite Museum in Long Beach, OR.
