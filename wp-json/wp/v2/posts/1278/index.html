In my dream I had forgotten about it and I was scrambling around trying to be sure everything was ready.  In the midst of it all, people kept stopping me to talk to me.  I was trying to be polite but I was very preoccupied with getting ready for both communion and the wedding.  The people who wanted to chat with me were all nice people who were glad to see me and I was trying to be &#8220;nice&#8221; and move on to talking to the groom and bride because we hadn&#8217;t even had a rehearsal.
