The reason we pushed so hard was that Lubbock and vicinity was supposed to have winds with gusts of 40 mph the next day. You really don&#8217;t want to tow a RV this big in winds like that. So we pushed hard and then settled in for a couple of nights at Lake Sumner State Park near Fort Sumner, NM.<\/p>\n<p>Out here on the high plains a lake is an unusual and welcome sight. The park is about 6 miles east of highway 84. You travel over some hills and then, as you approach the park there are some twists and turns that take you up and over the dam and spillway to the entrance of the park. The route in had my attention but it was doable and I wouldn&#8217;t let it keep me from returning. Pecos Campground is the campground with water and 30 amp electric hookups. Just about every site has a view of the lake. There&#8217;s good Verizon cell service in the park, yielding a good 4G data flow.<\/p>\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve had a couple of days at a very quiet state park. A small but intense thunderstorm got our attention for awhile last night, but we didn&#8217;t even get any rain from it as it brushed just past us to the north. Also, the wind has made itself known (but at least it&#8217;s not up in the 40&#8217;s). Tomorrow we head for Albuquerque.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We did a couple of 300+ mile days getting out of Texas.
