When it comes to campgrounds it&#8217;s basic real estate: location, location, location. We felt like we got a better site than we had on our previous visit and because of that, we liked the campground better than we did then.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pastorscott.com\/tag\/horseshoe\">Other reviews are here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, things are pretty much the same as they were when we were here four years ago and that&#8217;s not a bad thing. The setting is beautiful and most of the campsites available to those of us who travel are nice while not the best ones. The best spots with wonderful views of the lakes are taken by long timers. Many of these folks have made lots of upgrades to their sites, turning them into showplaces.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-1pkG6ztaa9w\/X5C0Ro-wW9I\/AAAAAAABHC0\/mWXbGErDuw4ZqQW3kdIfueiILDtpyuZ4gCPcBGAsYHg\/s2048\/IMG_0058.JPG\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1530\" class=\"aligncenter size-large\" \/><br \/>\nAs I said, we liked our site. It sits on a finger of land with drop offs on either side, giving us some really nice separation from those on either side of us. While it isn&#8217;t one of the really great spots overlooking a lake, it was one of our favorite spots so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>This being Independence Day weekend there were lots of people around. However, I think I counted two empty spots (although they may well have been due to no-shows). The campground was in great shape and there were some nice events including a &#8220;zoo&#8221; with interesting animals and a barbecue with the meat provided by the campground.<\/p>\n<p>Our Verizon signal was good and I was able to get 2 of my 3 Dish Network satellites through the trees. We had one low voltage episode in which our Surgeguard cut power to the camper for a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>This is a pretty campground and we&#8217;ll likely return when future travels bring us to western Indiana.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSbUgO3ZXyWwMhOgnXSPn1mdNnOA1nUJ0kW9zzzUReeRxFfEn9Pjyc1IYpSfVUWk73qyStPfqBsq6zz\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I think we like Horseshoe Lakes Thousand Trails, near Clinton, Indiana better than we liked it on our first visit.
