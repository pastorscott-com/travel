We were ready to slow down, do a few small projects, and get ready for our slow move back to Texas. The very fact that we planned on a longer stay at Kenisee is a clue as to how much we like this campground.<\/p>\n<p>This is our third stay at Kenisee Lake Thousand Trails in Jefferson, OH. Since I reviewed the campground after both previous stays so I&#8217;ll just post some new photos and pretty much let that be my review.<\/p>\n<p>The previous reviews are: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2013\/07\/15\/campground-review-kenisee-lake-thousand-trails-jefferson-oh\/\">2013<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2018\/07\/03\/2018-kenisee-lake-thousand-trails-jefferson-ohio\/\">2018<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This stay, we have been in one of the big pull-throughs in the rear of the campground. These sites are long enough for the biggest of rigs and easy to get and and out of. We like the size of the sites, and at times we like being a bit isolated from the activity in the rest of the campground. We think it is both good and bad that these sites are quite a ways from the Activity Center, pool, and bath houses.<\/p>\n<p>The last time we were at Kenisee we had lots of rain and our site sometimes felt a bit like an island surrounded by water. This stay we have had good weather most of the time. When it did rain, we noticed that the same sites we were in last time got muddy but work that has been done cleaning out drainage ditches behind them has made a difference. Overall, we have enjoyed the cool temps and sunny days.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vSVwVtCmhsAn_xG3hpwHSJtT7gsNsU5uMgpL-nvsMKlUMTvgjuOde4Bh5uwEaI77dkcRb5MYGB2DJLp\/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our stay here this year has been the longest stop of our 2019 Adventure.
