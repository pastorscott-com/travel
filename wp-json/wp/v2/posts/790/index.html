We stopped at the Visitor\u2019s Center and looked at the displays and watched the video introducing the park. I was surprised that in spite of it\u2019s beauty Canyonlands was not made a National Park until 1964.<\/p>\n<p>We followed the main route and took the short hike to Mesa Arch. While we were driving and talking about the park I accidentally said it was an &#8220;abunderful&#8221; place and it truly is both abundant and beautiful. \u00a0Each overlook is breath-taking and the main stops are easy walks. Canyonlands National Park has been called the Grand Canyon of Utah. \u00a0I can see the resemblance with its amazing canyons, beautiful colors, towers, and views of the Green and Colorado Rivers. \u00a0We hope to visit this &#8220;abunderful&#8221; place again someday.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Canyonlands NP although we only saw the Island in the Sky and not The Maze or The Needles.
