We moved into the 5th wheel and our new, less-cluttered-with-belongings life began.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lot of people ask for advice on downsizing in preparation for fulltiming.\u00a0 Given that everyone&#8217;s specific circumstances are unique, there&#8217;s no one size fits all approach to this but I can tell you what we did.
