They are everywhere and rather tame &#8211; hanging out in campsites expecting the humans to feed them.  Being around these graceful animals is a treat.  At the same time having so many so close at hand means that their droppings give the campsites a bit of a barnyard feel &#8211; if you get my meaning!
