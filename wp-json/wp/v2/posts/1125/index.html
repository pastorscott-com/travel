This is a large campground, a bit rough, but with lots of campsites \u2013 many of them with full hookups and large enough to accommodate most any rig. The route to the campground includes driving down some residential streets in an area that is a bit run down. Be sure to watch for the big \u201cturn before this sign\u201d sign on Park Road 37.<\/p>\n<p>There are three primary sections of this Thousand Trails preserve. One section is near the front gate and the large pool. The sites closest to the pool (Section A) are water\/electric only but nearby is full hookup Section R which is popular with those with big rigs. About a mile in from the front gate is Section F which is closer to the big Activity Center and mini-golf. These sites are full hookup. Adjacent to that area and still farther from the front gate are Sections B and C. These are water\/electric sites. At one time these were very popular sites due to their proximity to Medina Lake.<\/p>\n<p>Alas, these days Medina Lake is more valley than lake. Nearer the dam and a distance from the campground there\u2019s a bit of water, but at the campground there\u2019s no water to be seen. Medina Lake has a history of going through dry spells but the current one has lasted over 10 years now. I wouldn\u2019t count this lake out. Someday it will make a comeback but for now this is a campground overlooking a valley and offering zero lake access.<\/p>\n<p>What the campground lacks in water it makes up for in deer. They are everywhere and rather tame &#8211; hanging out in campsites expecting the humans to feed them. Being around these graceful animals is a treat. At the same time having so many so close at hand means that their droppings give the campsites a bit of a barnyard feel &#8211; if you get my meaning! Also, one has to wonder just how healthy it is for this dense a deer population.<\/p>\n<p>San Antonio with all it has to offer is around an hour away. Bandera, which is called the &#8220;Cowboy capital of Texas&#8221; is nearby. Also there are several nice Hill Country drives and destinations a reasonable distance away.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/2021\/08\/23\/2021-lake-medina-thousand-trails-lakehills-tx\/\">A 2021 review is here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Were Medina Lake full this campground would be a real gem. As it is, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s &#8220;okay&#8221; without being &#8220;especially special&#8221; in any way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff Medina Lake Thousand Trails is located in the Texas Hill Country, one of our favorite parts of Texas.
