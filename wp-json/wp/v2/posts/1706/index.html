After finding a parking place near a mall entrance we circled each of the three main levels, taking our time, enjoying the experience. There are many familiar stores and others I didn\u2019t recognize. I especially enjoyed going into the Lego Store and seeing the huge completed figures on display there. I also liked the American Girl store and the Boys Adventure Store.<\/p>\n<p>There are several attractions beyond shopping and eating. We walked through Nickelodeon Universe, an amusement park with a zip-line, several roller coasters, a flume ride, and a number of other rides for all ages. I can only imagine how popular this indoor venue is during the cold Minnesota winters. There is also the Sea Life Minnesota Aquarium and Moose Mountain Adventure Golf. In the exhibit area right now there&#8217;s the Barbie Dream House experience and a Star Trek exhibition.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to see why this is a must-see place for visitors in this area.<\/p>\n<p>Sorry to say because of some issues with the camper as well as some health-related issues we didn&#8217;t get to see several of the other area attractions we planned on seeing here. That will have to be done on a future visit!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon at the Mall of America.
