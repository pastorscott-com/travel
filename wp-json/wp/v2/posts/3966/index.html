Honestly, neither of us are race fans but Scott said he was about burned out on Revolutionary and Civil War history and ready for a change of pace. We assumed that this museum, being a bit off the beaten track and open at only limited times, would be a smaller one.  We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to find it to be packed full of interesting cars and other racing memorabilia.  In spite of the large collection, the Museum entrance fee is by donation only. This facility is a nonprofit staffed with volunteers taking care of everything. We enjoyed seeing the wide variety of racing cars, plus motorcycles and other racing gear. There is an amazing amount of information about the cars and drivers plus jackets, helmets and other clothing along with biographies, photos, trophies and other items.  Even those like us who aren&#8217;t racing fans will find this to be a great museum visit.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vRFIxGU9PK3azG3FzLk7PwAsxarPSlxFYrCgUFHYa-Ayk9VN0NpPAhZ2xMnfTgSRScBYhTNcvW_PO3j\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking at the map of the area around York, PA Scott saw that the Eastern Museum of Motor Racing was near our campground so we decided to check it out.
