They are in the original building where the Hulman family business was begun in 1850. They started as a wholesale warehouse and expanded to to manufacturing under various names. The museum is free and open to the public. There you will see beautifully restored items from the past. There is a Victorian living room with a winding stairway and early phonograph player, a room like an old saloon with a wooden Indian, kitchen appliances, a wagon used to deliver goods and communication devices including many early telephones and many signs from the company&#8217;s early days. One display is of particular interest. It is a vault with replicas of gold bars and a desk set up to look like it might have looked in the past with ledgers open for business. There is a coffee shop where Scott bought some Rex brand coffee and I had a cinnamon roll. It tasted wonderful and I would recommend this as a place to visit if you are in the area.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vS9FPfX62vC4JEPUVUmoZSP8uLSSQQa9_yKPRbZgnrZWThb0D86aXa_c7OKEdjS9fI8MRc-MmhGMAdf\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"299\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/fullscreen-150x72.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"72\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-3672\" \/>Click this for full screen photos<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jackie writes&#8230; We also went to Terre Haute to the Clabber Girl Museum and coffee shop.
