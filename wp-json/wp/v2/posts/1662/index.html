There\u2019s something for everyone \u2013 from shopping malls to independent stores, from amusement parks to shows. Since this is a world-class tourism area there\u2019s no shortage of things to see and do. You can search the internet to see all that is available\u2026I\u2019ll just tell you about what we did on this visit. On future visits we\u2019re sure to find many other attractions to enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>Our family caught the courtesy downtown trolley near the free parking at The Landing and rode to Main Street where the old downtown Branson shops are. We especially enjoyed Dick\u2019s Five and Dime store which is very popular and is a great place to pick up small items. I also enjoyed the ice cream and fudge shops. There are several antique stores around town and we had fun looking at all the things for sale. Saturday night we went to a free outdoor jazz concert by the Taneycomo Festival Orchestra at the Fountain on The Lake. This group is a nonprofit organization that gives two weeks of free concerts during the summer. They were very good!<\/p>\n<p>Silver Dollar City was fun and in spite of the rain we enjoyed the shops, rides, and a special exhibition by the Harlem Globe Trotters. Our day at Silver Dollar City was special to us because our son and family planned a vacation trip to coincide with our being here. It was fun being with them at the amusement park.<\/p>\n<p>We also visited the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rfostermuseum.com\">Ralph Foster Museum<\/a>, at the College of the Ozarks. This is a great museum with something for everyone. We got a kick out of seeing the original vehicle used in the &#8220;Beverly Hillbillies&#8221; TV series &#8211; after all Jed and his family supposedly discovered &#8220;Texas tea&#8221; right here in these Ozark mountains. There are several collections at the museum including dolls, weapons, and natural history.<\/p>\n<p>Branson and vicinity a great vacation destination and we&#8217;re looking forward to future visits and adventures here on future travels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeffClick this for full screen photos Branson, MO is a very interesting and entertaining town.
