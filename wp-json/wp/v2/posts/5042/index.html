Zermatt, Switzerland &#8211; the Matterhorn &#8211; Scott and Jackie<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>We arrived back &#8220;home&#8221; in Manchester a bit weary but more than satisfied with our trip to Italy and Switzerland.\u00a0 Here are some random thoughts as we wrap up our trip.<\/p>\n<p>It was an all-public transportation trip.\u00a0 Over the last 10 days we traveled by bus, plane, subway, trolley, boat, Uber, and, of course, train.\u00a0 It is quite an experience for Americans who are fully immersed in the car culture to travel totally as passengers on public transport.\u00a0 It certainly is nice to look out the window or read a book while someone else handles the trip!<\/p>\n<p>This journey was, of course, all about the trains.\u00a0 Jackie and I enjoyed the Italian high-speed trains.\u00a0 They are big and roomy; smooth and quiet.\u00a0 Our Swiss trains, of course were all about the view.<\/p>\n<p>The trains we traveled on in Switzerland were all narrow gauge.\u00a0 That means the tracks and, therefore, the cars are narrower.\u00a0 \u00a0Most of the time it didn&#8217;t make much difference but, on the Bernina Express it did.\u00a0 We were in second class where the seats face one another in groups of four.\u00a0 Jackie and I decided it would be better to spend the four-hour trip looking at one another (and with both of us having window seats).\u00a0 That meant two other passengers on the full train sat beside of us.\u00a0 They were nice people, but they didn&#8217;t speak much English, so we spent those hours listening to them speaking French to one another and to several other family members on the other side of the train car.\u00a0 While traveling in second class worked great on all the other journeys we took, I think we&#8217;d opt spend the extra money and go for first class if we were ever to take that excursion again.\u00a0 The first-class cars have two seats on one side and one seat on the other.\u00a0 Much more room.<\/p>\n<p>I confess that photography on the train was a challenge.\u00a0 The train keeps moving and there are reflections in the windows.\u00a0 I just took lots of photos and then deleted most of them, leaving only the ones I thought looked best.<\/p>\n<p>If you ever plan on traveling by train in Europe, check out this web site \u2013 I got tons of great information there: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.seat61.com\/\">https:\/\/www.seat61.com\/<\/a> is a great resource.<\/p>\n<p>Jackie and I were really blessed with the weather.\u00a0 Not only was it unseasonably warm, but it also didn&#8217;t rain or snow on us the entire trip.\u00a0 We couldn&#8217;t have ordered better weather for a January in the Alps!<\/p>\n<p>My biggest budget miss was the cost of food.\u00a0 Switzerland, in particular, was very expensive.\u00a0 Just a hamburger and fries were over $20 a person.\u00a0 When traveling, we generally try to eat one nicer meal each day, and then, in the evening, eat a sandwich, etc.\u00a0 \u00a0Even that approach was a challenge. \u00a0We often went to a grocery store and bought ready-made sandwiches with chips to take back to the hotel for supper.\u00a0 Those sandwiches usually ran $7-8 each.\u00a0 Two of the &#8220;best&#8221; deals were German Doner Kebab restaurants (lots of meat!) and many pizzerias.\u00a0 I do like pizza, but not as a daily staple!<\/p>\n<p>I researched hotels on Google, trying to find highly rated ones, for reasonable prices, that were close to train stations.\u00a0 We were satisfied with all of them.\u00a0 All but one offered breakfast with the stay.\u00a0 The breakfasts were pretty good.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll close out my writing with this.\u00a0 Thanks to all who have read along.\u00a0 Comments are always welcome and encourage me to keep writing.\u00a0 All of the posts in this series can be easily found in our travel blog: http:\/\/localhost\/pastorscott\/travel\/tag\/italy-switzerland\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We arrived back &#8220;home&#8221;
