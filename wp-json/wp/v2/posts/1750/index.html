The area was filled with tourists like us taking pictures and enjoying the bronze figurative sculptures of Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi by the husband and wife team of Julie Roblatt-Amrany and Omri Amrany in front of the building.

We enjoyed browsing the pro shop and seeing photos of some of the famous athletes that played there.<\/p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s sister Susan was with us part of the time we were in this area.
