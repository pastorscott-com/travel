We especially enjoy exploring areas that are new to us and this was new territory for both of us. Near our campground was Bushkill Falls. It&#8217;s advertised as the Niagara of Pennsylvania. This is a commercial park with other things to do but we came for the main attraction: the waterfalls. There are four trails and hiking these trails takes from 15 minutes for the easiest one to two and a half hours for the longest. We took the 2nd level trail that focuses on the main falls. Our path was well kept and included several steps and viewing platforms. The falls are quite impressive and well worth the effort and expense to see them. There are many other activities available for families including a Native American exhibit, a wildlife exhibit, gift and snack bar, a fudge kitchen, and ice cream bar. Near the entrance is a pond with paddle boats and fishing gear, a playground with picnic tables, and a mini golf course. <\/p>\n<p>We also enjoyed touring Grey Towers National Historic Site. This palatial summer home was planned and built by James Pinchot who was not only the first Chief of the National Forest Service but also was twice elected governor of Pennsylvania.  Grey Towers was also used by his son Gifford and his wife Cornelia and her touch is evident throughout the home and across the property. The home was modeled after the Marquis de LaFayette\u2019s home. The grounds are open and free of charge. We paid to take the guided tour and saw several rooms on the main floor. The rooms are filled with family heirlooms and items brought home from their vast travels. Our guide also talked about the landscaping and the gardens created by Cornelia. There is a long narrow pool built in such a way as to make it seem longer than it really is. The one area I found especially interesting was \u201cThe Finger Bowl.\u201d  This outdoor dining area is beautifully shaded by a wisteria covered arbor. The &#8220;bowl&#8221; is a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge that served as a sort of counter or table top. People were seated around the pool on comfortable chairs and food was served from wooden bowls floating on the water. The diners would &#8220;pass&#8221; the food by floating it across to one another.  The entire property is a beautiful, quiet place with many benches and gazebos where a person can enjoy the landscaping and scenery.<\/p>\n<p>We ate at a couple of good places, but no place with a &#8220;finger bowl.&#8221;  Our favorite was Philly Steaks in Stroudsburg.  We split a cheesesteak and fries and were glad we did!  The portions were huge.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s enjoyed driving around this area, seeing the beautiful Pocono&#8217;s and lush forests.  It is easy to see why this area has drawn people from the nearby big cities for many decades.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/e\/2PACX-1vQv4p-HYCsDw2jvhYvxNvaYRdj9jbhHu7ucRIK-rjfrcGTAfxNPZe0WVn2g1A86UNXV3_sGisKK4_57\/embed?start=true&#038;loop=true&#038;delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/22ufCD8ueasGgYMC9\">See individual photos and captions here.<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are spent a week in the Pocono\u2019s of Pennsylvania; an area I\u2019ve heard of all my life.
