We wanted a fairly \u201clocal\u201d experience and the Muffin Man was just the right place.&nbsp; It\u2019s on a side street, but fairly easy to find (that is unless one misses the street and walks a few blocks before deciding they must have missed it!).&nbsp; We checked out the local map at a bus stop and found that our street was the very first one we crossed a few blocks earlier.&nbsp; One thing about London, the streets aren\u2019t very well marked.&nbsp; Your best chance is to look up on the sides of buildings near an intersection.&nbsp; Even then it doesn\u2019t always work out.&nbsp; Anyway, we had a nice lunch with some tasty Earl Grey tea and then Queen Mother\u2019s Cake for dessert.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

I think it\u2019s the biggest store I\u2019ve ever seen and it reminds me of Macy\u2019s but with a wider variety of merchandise.&nbsp; Jackie had a terrific time looking around.&nbsp; I had to restrain her from buying granddaughter Sarah a $600 party dress and grandson Matthew a diamond covered model car.&nbsp; I couldn\u2019t stop her at the chocolate confectionary though and she blew through a few English pounds on chocolate pretty fast.&nbsp; She nearly persuaded me on a few $1000 men\u2019s suits, but I managed to hang in there.&nbsp; I did seriously check out a $3000 comfortable chair (on sale, mind you) for about a half hour while she looked around.&nbsp; Visiting this store is, seriously, an event not to be missed.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;

London has several wonderful parks, but I think Hyde is the best known.&nbsp; The weather was perfect and the park was filled with people enjoying the late afternoon.&nbsp; We sat on a park bench and people watched as joggers, skate boarders, and bicyclists passed by.&nbsp; A lot of people were out on the the grass picnic style \u2013 and I mean a lot \u2013 thousands of people enjoying the park.<\/p>\n<p>We waited till around 6:30 before getting on the tube to head back out to Canary Wharf, hoping the rush hour would be backing down.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; We were packed in like sardines.&nbsp; It\u2019s rather comical really.&nbsp; All these people obviously standing too close for comfort, hanging on to the rails, bouncing and swaying in rhythm\u2026and no one talking or even acknowledging one another.&nbsp; No eye contact.&nbsp; It\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t courteous, they offer seats to the elderly, make room for one more \u201csardine\u201d to be packed in till there\u2019s literally not room for another person.&nbsp; It\u2019s quite an experience.<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting thing is what a hurry everyone is in.&nbsp; No one really walks \u2013 but, instead, they move at almost a jog.&nbsp; A sign on the escalator advises people to \u201cstand right\u201d so all the runners can charge by on the left.&nbsp; They\u2019re in a hurry to where ever it is they are going.&nbsp; In similar fashion to the tube, people generally don\u2019t acknowledge one another.&nbsp; If you ask someone for directions, they will politely help you out, but otherwise, people seem invisible to one another.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re finding it easy to get around so far as the big picture is concerned but a bit harder to find exact places because of the lack of street signs.&nbsp; Of course finding one\u2019s way is half the fun!<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: white; color: #666666; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Trebuchet, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;\">You can see lots of photos from our trip on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/101128941131953400860\/2011LondonTrip#\" style=\"color: #538cd6;
