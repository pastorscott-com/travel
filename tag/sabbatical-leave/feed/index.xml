										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning we hiked a short trail to Juneywhank Falls in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park near Bryson City, NC. It is a terrific spot. At the time we mistakenly thought there were some other nearby falls so we didn&#8217;t stay there as long as we would have otherwise. After leaving the falls we hiked on up the trail for about a half hour before deciding we had had enough for the day. I walk a lot, but, since we live in the flat lands, the up and down mountain hiking works the leg muscles in an entirely different way. <br /><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2008/05/Deep-River-Smoky-Mountain-National-Park-Bryson-City-NC-5-15-2008-10-47-13-AM.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img decoding="async" alt="" border="0" src="//wp-content/uploads/2008/05/Deep-River-Smoky-Mountain-National-Park-Bryson-City-NC-5-15-2008-10-47-13-AM-225x300.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing we got our hike in this morning, as we have a drizzly, lazy afternoon going now. We have the awning up and are sitting outside enjoying the 65 degree mountain air. Tomorrow we head up into the GSMNP for some camping. That means no Internet, no cell phone, no electricity. It also means quiet, majestic beauty. It sounds like a good trade to me.</p>
