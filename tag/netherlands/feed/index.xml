It was a wonderful trip.  Lots of beautiful scenery &#8211; really, that trip alone was the trip of a lifetime.  </p>
<p>From there, it was back to <a href="/2022/07/21/settling-into-our-uk-adventure/">Nazarene Theological College</a> in Manchester.  We enjoyed our year there; especially making many great friends at the college, where we lived and volunteered, and at Longsight Community Church of the Nazarene, where we worshipped. </p>
<p>We took full advantage of the travel opportunities available to us, with visits to <a href="/tag/ireland/">Ireland</a>, the <a href="/tag/netherlands/">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/tag/scotland/">Scotland</a>, and the great attractions local to <a href="/tag/uk/">Manchester</a>.</p>
<p>In June we said farewell to our friends in the UK and returned to Houston for an entirely different sort of Adventure.  After looking at serval houses we settled on one &#8211; but with a bit of concern about various projects that would need doing fairly soon.</p>
<p>The next day, a different listing became available.  One look at this house and we felt it was &#8220;the one!&#8221;  A bit of negotiating and we signed on the dotted line &#8211; after years of fulltime RVing and then a year in England we had a &#8220;stix and brix&#8221; place of our own.  </p>
<p>As I said, &#8220;what a year it was!&#8221;</p>
<p>While we are happy with our new house we still have the itch to do some traveling.  Our New Year will start with a Carribean cruise and there are a few other things on the horizon.  </p>
<p>We know we are blessed in every way.  Thanks for following along.</p>
