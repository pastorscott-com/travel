I am amazed at the size of the some of the equipment used now when compared to the old tractors and plows that were pulled by horses or oxen.   We saw the golden plow that was at various World fairs and trade shows.  Along one entire wall the history of the Company is shown with other historical memorabilia starting in the 1800’s. </span></p>
<p>We had a lot of fun visiting John Deere and recommend it as a great place to spend an afternoon.</p>
