However, it was still there.  One rivet has leaked – I’ll have to fix it with a dab of silicone.  With the survival of the little camper, my survival plan has worked out.   I fired up the propane refrigerator and we moved everything we could into it.  I then filled our trusty old Coleman camp stove with fuel and set it up in the garage.  We also have the propane BBQ grill next to the camper.  We have the Coleman with two burners, the camper with a two burner stove and the grill for cooking.  Dish washing still takes place in the house, but otherwise the garage has become our kitchen.  We’re very thankful that our community water supply has not been compromised and we have had no “boil water” orders.</p>
