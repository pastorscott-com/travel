There are several tourist oriented, colorful, and fun shops in the oldest part of Rockport. There are also art galleries as well as furniture stores.</p>
<p>If you like to eat out there are many restaurants here offering just about anything you could ask for at varying prices. We found every place to be very busy most of the time, mainly because there are a lot of Winter Texans here. You&#8217;ll probably laugh, but my favorite spot here is the Dairy Queen because they serve chocolate soft serve ice cream! We look forward to returning to Rockport/Fulton again.</p>
