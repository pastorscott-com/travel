										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An easy &#8220;cruise-control drive&#8221; west on I10 returned us to Texas.  We&#8217;re bound for a longer landing near Houston but for now we&#8217;re still in &#8220;approach&#8221; mode, spending a few days here near Livingston, then a couple of weeks in Conroe before doing our major stop for the winter.</p>

Maybe most impressive is the Care Center &#8211; it is an absolutely unique place providing assisted living facilities for people who retired to RVing but are now unable to travel.  It&#8217;s a wonderful program that serves a great need.</p>
<p>Our time here is short and, in addition to that, it has rained almost constantly since our arrival.  Because of that we haven&#8217;t gotten to know the campground as well as we would have otherwise.</p>
<p>Off hand, I&#8217;d say this place does just what it&#8217;s intended to do.  It probably doesn&#8217;t measure up to some of the nicer RV Resorts, but no where is as geared to fulltime RVers as is this place.  My guess is that we&#8217;ll return here about once a year for a short stay.  After all, it is &#8220;where we live.&#8221;</p>
