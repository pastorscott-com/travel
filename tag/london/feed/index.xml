<p>London is a terrific tourist city with several world class attractions and also interesting architecture at every turn.  We spent our last day there just looking around.  We took the ferry out to Greenwich and back, and then just looked around the city.  </p>
<p>As any of our friends know, no, we didn&#8217;t ride the London Eye.  Jackie was perfectly happy to see it from the ground.  I could have ridden it by myself, but what&#8217;s the fun in that!  We did, though, check it out and got several interesting photos of it.  Anyway, as you can see we had fun in London!</p>
