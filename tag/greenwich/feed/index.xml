<p>For Sunday our intention was to take a breather from sightseeing and make it a day of worship and rest.&nbsp; We started our day at Westminster Abbey at their 10:00 worship service.&nbsp; We got there just after they closed entry to the part of the church where the main service was taking place and ended up sitting in the “Nave” with 20 or so other people.&nbsp; We could see through into the service well enough to see the men and boy’s choir as well as see the clergyman as he delivered a Sunday sermon. &nbsp;Also, the organ was beautiful. &nbsp;Every inch of the church has statues, etc. but we were able to focus on worship.&nbsp; There’s something powerful about stating the Apostle’s Creed in the place where it has been said for over 1000 years.&nbsp; Also, the singing of the Lord’s Prayer was deeply moving.&nbsp; The sermon was quite good and we came away feeling we had genuinely worshiped.&nbsp; To keep tourists from coming to church just to keep from paying a tour fee they have a strict “no pictures” policy on Sundays.&nbsp; It’s quite understandable but we wish we had been able to take at least a couple of photos to help us remember the meaningful worship service.</p>

<p>For lunch we headed over to Greenwich market.&nbsp; However, the crowds were so large that we walked though just to see what the food and other venders had and then, out on the street we spotted a real English Fish and Chips restaurant.&nbsp; We split a meal and had food left over!&nbsp; We walked over the the Maritime Museum that we visited the day we arrived.&nbsp; At that time we were sleep deprived that we only saw a small part of it.&nbsp; Today we saw a bit more before making the short jump back to Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>This area of London is considered to be the “Wall Street” of London with skyscrapers and lots of people in suits hurrying around.&nbsp; The tube and the DLR or “light rail” intersect here as well as public transport via the river Thames.&nbsp; Our 7 or 8 minute walk to public transportation takes us across a nifty bridge and into a large shopping mall surrounded by office buildings.&nbsp; We’re taking it easy through the afternoon here at the half way mark of our trip.</p>
