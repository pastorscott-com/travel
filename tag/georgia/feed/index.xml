Little Tallapoosa Park is located on the outskirts of Carrollton, GA and a short distance from I20. We enjoyed our week at this pretty park. There are two campground loops. One is more suited for tents and smaller rigs. The &#8220;RV Campground&#8221; has sites that will handle larger rigs. Several of those sites are pull through. Those around the parameter, and a few others are nice back-ins. In the pull-throughs pay attention to your campsite entry and exit points as some are ramped. We could see some drag marks to the front of our site so we opted to back out upon leaving rather than chance just driving out. I&#8217;m not sure all the sites are level but many are. Ours was quite good. The RV sites are all 50 amp/FHU. It may be difficult to get satellite TV from the parameter sites on the south side but it was an easy shot from our spot. Our Verizon signal was solid.</p>
<p>The roads are all good and the park boasts some very nice paved trails, a small playground, a nice bathhouse with laundry, and a splash pad that I&#8217;m sure gets lots of use in the summertime. The town of Carrollton has all the stores you will need and downtown Atlanta is less than an hour away.</p>
<p>This county park is a winner and we will happily return to it on future visits to the Atlanta area.</p>
