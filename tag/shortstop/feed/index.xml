We got away from Lake Texoma Thousand Trails on Monday afternoon, so the 140 miles down to High View CoE in Ennis, TX was just about the right distance.  Knowing the Artic cold front was coming, we only hooked up electricity.  <a href="//2020/08/25/2020-high-view-coe-campground-ennis-tx/">As I said in my previous review</a>, the water hookup is behind the back of the sites.  My heated hose isn&#8217;t nearly long enough to reach that far.  Not only that, but the water hookup is just a bare pipe sticking up about 3 feet out of the ground.  By morning, the water was frozen up, so hooking up would have been a waste of time.  The cold weather brought winter storm conditions, especially south of us so we decided to just stay put a couple of extra days.  One of the nice things about living in a RV full time is that you always have the option to &#8220;run&#8221; from threatening weather or to hunker down and wait out challenging travel conditions.  After three nights, though, we were ready to head south again.</p>
<p>We enjoyed the nice lake view out our front window.  We also enjoyed seeing a large flock of cardinals &#8211; I counted 19 of the pretty red birds in our &#8220;back yard.&#8221;</p>
