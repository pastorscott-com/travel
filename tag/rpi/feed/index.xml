We stopped off at Quinebaug Cove Campground in Brimfield, MA for just a couple of nights as we worked our way on north.  One of our campground memberships is with RPI and this campground is included in that membership.  We are supposed to be able to stay in RPI campgrounds for $10 but booking costs another $2 and, upon arrival I was informed that since I wanted electricity there is another $3 a night tacked on.  It&#8217;s still a low price but a surcharge for electricity seems a bit over the top to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, our campsite was reasonably level and very close to our neighbors on each side.  Really, there is barely room for an awning to be put out.  Also, since the campsites are rather shallow, the only place to park our pickup was between us and the folks next to us.  This makes the &#8220;packed in&#8221; feeling even more pronounced.  </p>
<p>There are other sites for travelers at the top of a rather steep hill.  I saw several campers up there, and the sites are roomier, but I wasn&#8217;t sure I wanted to pull our 5th wheel up such a steep hill.  Since our stay was only two nights I was okay with the tight quarters where we were.</p>
<p>The campground has a nice big pool and several kids were enjoying it.  The nearby town of Sturbridge is historical with lots of shops.  We opted to spend our day going to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, about 40 minutes away.  </p>
<p>My Verizon signal was great and I was able to get satellite TV by putting our tripod just outside our front door and raising it to its maximum height.  This was one of those rare times when having a roof mounted dish would have actually been an advantage.</p>
<p>Everyone I talked to in the campground, especially the staff, was friendly and helpful.  I think this place is okay for travelers who want a brief stop or for those who want a seasonal spot to get out of the city. As a traveler it wouldn&#8217;t be very high on my list as a place to spend anything beyond a night or two. </p>
