<p>From the beginning we&#8217;ve planned to make Tuesday a laundry-and-not-much-else-planned day and that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s been. &nbsp;We slept in and then got started on laundry using the washer/dryer in our studio flat. &nbsp;For lunch, though, we ventured out to explore more of the huge shopping center a few minutes walk way in Canary Wharf. </p>
<p>One thing Jackie wanted to do was (I know this will amaze you) find the local library, called the &#8220;Idea Store.&#8221; &nbsp;She looked it over and then we wandered through the mall before deciding to have some Thai food for lunch. &nbsp;We had a nice rice/chicken/spices meal along with a couple of pots of tea. &nbsp;It was quite good and filling.</p>
<p>After lunch we walked over the a community park that is situated right on the Thames. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a very nice walkway along the river and we strolled there for awhile before returning to the flat to finish up laundry.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-59.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img decoding="async" border="0" height="240" src="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-59-300x225.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>I did considerable research in finding a place to stay in London. &nbsp;It would be easy to spend a small fortune just on a hotel here. &nbsp;Basically, the closer one stays to the main tourist areas around Buckingham, Hyde Park, etc. the more money it will cost. &nbsp;However, if you are staying for a week or more, it&#8217;s worth the effort to find a flat to rent. &nbsp;Generally speaking the flat will cost a bit more but will give you a lot more room and cooking capability which is nice for breakfast and maybe an&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;meal. &nbsp;If you are willing to stay farther out, though, you can save some money. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time on <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">Tripadvisor</a> looking at reviews and found this place; outside the tourist area in, instead, the &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; of London. &nbsp;The cost was about the same as a tiny room in a &#8220;city&#8221; hotel but the&nbsp;accommodations&nbsp;are much better. &nbsp;One of the main things to think about when planning a London trip is that the tube gives you great access to everything. &nbsp;If you are close to a tube station you&#8217;re never far from the rest of London. &nbsp;By staying at Canary Wharf we&#8217;ve had easy access to a great shopping center with plenty of shops and restaurants plus easy access to the tube, the light rail, the river commuter services &#8211; all with Greenwich 10 minutes away one direction and the Tower of London 10 minutes away the other.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-9-27-2011-9-00-25-AM.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img decoding="async" border="0" height="180" src="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-9-27-2011-9-00-25-AM-300x169.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve found the people of London to be always in a hurry, always polite, and always willing to help if you ask them. &nbsp;We think they smoke too much and don&#8217;t like having to walk through a cloud of smoke around the doors of nearly every building. &nbsp;Sometimes we&#8217;ve struggled to understand what they say and they&#8217;ve struggled to understand us. &nbsp;We were surprised, though, at how many people there are speaking other languages. &nbsp;It&#8217;s as common to hear people speaking other languages as it is to hear English. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve seen many men in beards and turbans and women wearing veiled outfits. &nbsp;Those people, by the way, have never made us feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen less&nbsp;tattoos, more women wearing short skirts, and more men wearing dark suits with white shirts and black ties than we&#8217;ve seen at home. &nbsp;Some of that may be due to being out here with all the business types. </p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-86.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" border="0" height="320" src="//wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-London-86-225x300.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve been especially blessed by the weather. &nbsp;It has been just terrific with lots of beautiful sunshine and unseasonably warm&nbsp;temperatures. &nbsp;We came prepared for London&#8217;s fall weather and ended up enjoying the best of London&#8217;s summer weather instead. &nbsp;The jackets have been left on the hangers and the&nbsp;umbrellas&nbsp;haven&#8217;t been carried.&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone asks us about late September/early October London weather we&#8217;ll tell them it&#8217;s some of the best in the world &#8212; of course Londoners will laugh us out of the room when we say it!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
