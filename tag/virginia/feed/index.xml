We enjoyed our stay at Harbor View Thousand Trails in Colonial Beach, VA.  This is a smaller Thousand Trails with only 144 or so sites.  The campground is mostly level with decent spacing between the sites.  However, campsites in much of the campground are &#8220;back to back.&#8221;  There is room between sites, but the neighbor to the back will practically be bumper to bumper.  I will mention that there are a few pull through sites and also some tent sites.</p>
<p>This is one of the Thousand Trails campgrounds that have started assigning spots based on rig size.  We were led to our site by an employee on a golf cart.  The site was, indeed, suitable for us.  During the week there were a few vacant sites, but things pretty much filled up on the weekends.</p>
<p>The campground features a large pool, a basketball court with a new playing surface, and a mini-golf course which was being redone during our stay.  From what I could tell the campsites are all 50 amp/FHU sites.</p>
<p>The place has lots of tree cover providing welcome shade on hot, humid afternoons.  It also makes it practically impossible to get a satellite signal.  It looked to me like the seasonals have chosen a few spots that offer a &#8220;hole in the sky&#8221; for satellite.  I used all my satellite finding skill to spot one of the Dish Network satellites.  We didn&#8217;t get most of the channels we usually get but we got the baseball games we enjoy and that worked out for us.</p>
<p>The nearest Walmart is nearly 30 minutes away but Colonial Beach has a couple of grocery stores and plenty of eating places.  There are lots of historic attractions in the area and we enjoyed visiting several of them.</p>
<p>Harbor View doesn&#8217;t really offer a view of any harbor.  There&#8217;s a marina adjacent to the property on Mattox Creek but it isn&#8217;t associated with the campground.  No campsite has a view of even the creek although a few are close to a small fishing pond located in the campground.  My Verizon signal was quite good giving us solid data service.  </p>
<p>All in all, Harbor View is a nice place and worth adding to your Thousand Trails camping plans.</p>
