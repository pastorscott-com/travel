Once I could get out I drove a mile over to the church and found extensive damage there.  Still, aside from the loss our large patio cover and many shingles, the structure looked okay.  A quick drive around town revealed damage everywhere.  Honestly, my gut feeling was that our neighborhood had been hit by a series of small tornadoes and that other areas wouldn’t be so bad.  I was wrong.  Trees are down everywhere.  Signs are blown away.  Our Sonic drive in was demolished.  Streets are impassable and trees and power lines down everywhere.  Electric polls are snapped off or leaning along every road.  Returning home, we picked up what debris we had and helped around the neighborhood.  Some guys we don’t even know showed up with power saws and cleared the tree that was blocking the street.</p>
