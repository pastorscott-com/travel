										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pEBytvIHs5w/Wy6zOpFWZ6I/AAAAAAAAzCk/8FAA8YE3csEtJSFUytcrlzRIY3gdoay5ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IMG_20180224_120525.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="293" /> Our 4 1/2 month stay at San Jacinto Battleground where we have been volunteering on Battleship Texas is drawing to an end.  This has been our 4th season here.  It is nice feeling we are helping out and the staff always makes us feel appreciated.  We also like being close to family and friends during these winter stays.  We had more winter this year than we wanted with several cold, icy days.  All in all though, we have few complaints; enjoying meeting people and getting to know our fellow camp hosts.</p>
<p>This year, in addition to our hours volunteering, we have filled in as interim pastor at Baytown Nazarene.  The church isn&#8217;t far from us and we&#8217;ve helped out there the entire time we&#8217;ve been at our &#8220;winter quarters.&#8221;  The church family has treated us very well and it has been good getting to know them better.  If you add our time filling in at Denison prior to arriving at San Jacinto, I&#8217;ve ministered nearly every Sunday over the past 5-6 months.  No complaints, but it hasn&#8217;t felt very much like retirement to me!  Lord willing, I&#8217;ll enjoy some down time now that we&#8217;re beginning our 2018 Adventure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2744" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/map-150x130.png" alt="" width="150" height="130" />The closer we get to D-Day the more time I spend looking at potential travel routes and campgrounds.  Several reservations have already been made; especially at popular campgrounds during the busiest times of the year.   Our ultimate destination this year is the coast of Maine, but we won&#8217;t make it that far till mid- to late summer.  As a planner, I enjoy putting the trip together and then refining it. That process will continue all through the Adventure.</p>
<p>So, it won&#8217;t be long before we blast off.  We&#8217;ll keep posting sightseeing and campground reviews here to the blog.  Stay tuned!</p>
