We were at Beeds Lake State Park in Hampton, Iowa a couple of years ago <a href="/2015/07/05/campground-review-beeds-lake-state-park-hampton-ia/">and I did a review on it then</a>. Things are the same as they were then, so this will be another short review. We had a back in site on our previous visit, but this time we ended up in a &#8220;parallel parking&#8221; site. We were here before over Independence Day and the place was packed. This time we arrived during the county fair which takes place close by and the place was full once again. Our parallel parking site worked out just fine, although I chose it because it was on the end of the row and with a bit more elbow room than most. The 50 amp electric was solid and restrooms and showers were okay. I had a decent 4G signal until each evening. At that point the signal was strong enough but I think all the fair goers were overloading the system. Because of trees I was unable to get the Dish western arc satellites so I swapped out LNB&#8217;s and aimed for the eastern arc which I got with no problems.</p>
<p>Our feeling about Beeds Lake is about the same as it was before: it&#8217;s a nice spot if you are okay with electric only, an odd parking setup, and being 10 miles or so off of I35.</p>
