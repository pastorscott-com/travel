										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 17px;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We were camping out in the Texas panhandle, northeast of Amarillo a ways. &nbsp;It started out a typical panhandle day, lots of sunshine, dry air, and a modest 40 or 50 mph steady breeze from the southeast. &nbsp;I told my wife to be careful with the camper door when she went in and out and, wouldn&#8217;t you know it, it was me who stepped out without having a good tight grip of the door.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As luck would have it, the steady breeze gusted a bit about that time and the next thing I knew not only had the door been ripped out of my hand, but the wind blew into the camper with such force that the blew my camper wrong side out! &nbsp;It was so sad seeing all the cabinetry and fixtures there on the outside of the camper! &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We collected all our personal belongings the best we were able, but some were well on their way to Guymon, OK quicker than we could grab them.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So there I was with a wrong side out camper and not sure what to do next. &nbsp;About that time a fellow camper who just happened to have one of those fancy medium duty trucks came over and offered to help. &nbsp;We crawled inside the wrong side out camper with a chain and hooked it to the bumper, which was now inside rather than outside. &nbsp;We secured the other end to a handy fence post. &nbsp;Then we hooked another to the kingpin which was also inside the wrong side out camper. &nbsp;We connected the other end to his big truck. &nbsp;He revved up the diesel to the point that black smoke was billowing out his exhaust. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It took some doing and some spinning of his tires, but finally that camper popped right side out again.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After doing some re-caulking and re-tightening of some screws the camper was a good as new.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Needless to say, I&#8217;ve always been more careful when opening the door on my camper on windy days.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">That&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it.</span></p>
