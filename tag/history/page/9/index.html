<p>Fifteen miles north of Albuquerque, NM and just off of I25 on highway 550 is Coronado Campground, which is operated by the city of Bernalillo. For us, it&#8217;s a great stop because our journey will take us north on 550 once we leave.</p>
<p>We really like this campground. The sites are long, there are shelters on each campsite, and even AstroTurf carpeting. Hookups are water and electric with both 30 and 50 amp sites available. The water hookups, for some reason, are on the wrong side of the camper, so you&#8217;ll need a longer water hose for water.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t find the lack of sewer hookups to be a big of a deal because we were allowed to water the trees and plants around our campsite with our gray water.</p>
<p>This campground serves as a good center of operations for exploring Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It is probably a bit far off of I40 for those traveling that route (It&#8217;s about 17 miles from I40 to the campground).</p>
<p>For history buffs, the campground is adjacent to the Coronado Historic Site. Also, there are many restaurants and other businesses within minutes of the campground. Our Verizon 4G signal is quite good.</p>
<p>Due to high winds we extended our stay by an extra day.  The campground was a great place to be while we waited for better weather.  We give this place a thumbs up and will likely return.</p>

<p>Natchez, Mississippi is known for it’s antebellum home tours. We chose to go to Melrose which is operated by the National park service. There is some remodeling being done to the exterior but we enjoyed our tour with a volunteer guide. The McMurran family moved into this home right after it was built in 1841 and it has been restored to that era. We entered through the massive front door and stepped in the wide hall that runs the length of the house. The furniture and fixtures throughout are elegant and remind us that this was a family of means. The main hall floor is made of painted oilcloth that feels like linoleum. In the dining room is a large elegant table and there’s a large mahogany fan that has a pull rope to be used to keep the air moving around the diners at all times. Wood venetian blinds and silk curtains cover all the windows. There are bell pulls in each room running to a set of bells with different tones in the back of the house to summon a slave to that particular room when something was needed. There is also a room where the women could entertain, sew, and chat as well a separate room for the men to go to smoke and talk. The bed rooms upstairs are nicely furnished with four poster beds, day beds, desks for writing for the adults, and toys in the children’s room. Behind the big house is a two story building housing a kitchen, a cooling room for milk and other perishables. There are two other buildings for slaves that are open for viewing as well as buildings for the animals and carriages. Most of the flowers are gone this time of the year but gardens are still a nice place to visit. There are many different types of trees. The two that caught my attention are the very old and large Magnolia beside the house on one side and a sweet olive tree that has fragrant blooms on the other. We thought this was a very interesting and enjoyable tour.</p>
<p>From Melrose we drove downtown to visit the William Johnson house. He was a freed slave turned barber. William Johnson was freed by his white slave owner of the same name. As a boy he was trained to be a barber by his brother-in-law who was a free black man. William became a prosperous business man and land owner. He owned and operated three barbershops and a bathhouse in Natchez as well as property outside of town. We were surprised to learn that he, himself, was a slave owner. The family lived in town in the upper level of the house on State street over the commercial space. Johnson was a prolific writer who journaled daily. His journals not provide invaluable information about the day to day life of a free, and successful black man in Natchez. Sad to say, he was murdered in 1851 over a disputed land boundary.</p>
<p>Mount Locust Inn and Plantation is just a short drive north of Natchez on Natchez Trace Parkway. it is one of the oldest structures in the area. It was purchased by William Ferguson in 1784 as a farm. Since it was a day’s walk from Natchez this place became a stopping spot for the the “Kaintucks” who had floated their goods down the Mississippi and sold them in Natchez or New Orleans. They then walked the many miles back up the Natchez Trace. Mount Locust Inn provided a place to sleep and a meal of corn mush and milk. It started as a simple inn and later a four room, two story annex was added for the travelers. We enjoyed seeing the old house and taking a quiet walk around the grounds. We walked just a short distance along the Old Trace to see what the early travelers walked through on a beautiful sunny day.</p>
<p>Overall, we’ve thoroughly enjoyed exploring the areas along Natchez Trace Parkway; both the beauty of nature and the rich history of the area. In spite of our spending nearly a month along the Trace and spending time in three different area campgrounds we know we’ve barely scratched the surface of all there is to see and do along Natchez Trace Parkway. We hope to return in future journeys to continue enjoying the area.</p>

Our journey down historic Natchez Trace Parkway included a fun stop at historic French Camp, MS.  We took a break from driving the Parkway to look over the Visitor Center and Log Cabin Gift shop.  There’s a sorghum mill set up to show how sorghum was processed for use.  A boardwalk allows visitors to walk past Colonel James Drane’s Antebellum House and another historic house then down and around a blacksmith shop.  One of the buildings on the walk houses the Carriage used by the Last Chief of the Choctaw Nation east of the Mississippi to go to Washington DC to meet with Andrew Jackson concerning the Indian People.</p>
<p>We continued our drive down the Trace and to the state capitol of Mississippi, Jackson. The state park we’ve stayed in is named for the same Louis LeFleur we learned about at French Camp: LeFleur’s Bluff State Park which is wonderfully located in the city but feels as though it is out in the country. We took advantage of being so well located in the state capitol to visit some of the nearby museums.</p>
<p>Our visit to the Old Capitol gave us a glimpse of Mississippi history. The building has been restored to it’s original beauty and is a wonderful place to learn about Mississippi government. We started with an orientation film that tells the history of the building itself. We then followed the self guided tour starting with the Keeper of the Capitol’s room. In the early days this was woman who was responsible for opening and closing the building. There are interactive exhibits through out the building. We enjoyed seeing the restored House Gallery and Senate Chamber. This is great place to see how Mississippi government interacts.</p>
<p>The Museum of Natural Science was fun and would be even more enjoyable with children. There is a park entrance fee as well as museum fee but the price is still quite low. Entering the exhibit hall we saw the bones of extinct species of sea life and land animals. There are exhibits of endangered species of Mississippi as well as local waterfowl and wildlife. I enjoyed the aquatic habitats housing native fish, reptiles, and other water creatures. The aquariums are interesting and a greenhouse with a tank provides a home for a variety of alligators, turtles and fish. There&#8217;s a special exhibit on reptiles which I found both enticing and creepy with it&#8217;s many poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes. I especially enjoyed seeing the Gila monster. For those with preschoolers there&#8217;s a hands-on room where small children can climb a tree, play with puppets, visit animal habitats, and listen to stories. There is walk way around the building lots of interesting plantlife. For more about this museum go to <a href="http://www.msnaturalscience.org/">http://www.msnaturalscience.org/</a></p>

<p>Scott is loving towing the camper on Natchez Trace Parkway. No commercial traffic is allowed, there are no stop signs (and no advertizing of any kind), beautiful scenery, and a leisurely 50 mph speed limit. There are many turnouts, some at features to be seen along the way and others just for quiet picnic spots. Our drive from southern Tennessee, across the corner of Alabama, and into northeastern Mississippi was relaxing and beautiful. Sorry to say that the government’s partial shutdown closed some of the more major sights along the Parkway so we missed the Parkway’s main welcome center at Tupelo and a few other places of note along the way. We are disappointed with that. Still, we stopped for a short hike in one place and stopped at another to view Indian burial grounds.</p>
<p>Arriving at our campground in Tupelo we spent our time relaxing, doing a little shopping, and getting maintenance done on the truck. The only “touristy” thing we did while there was visit the Elvis Presley Birthplace and Park. There’s a gift shop, museum, the house where Elvis was born, and the church he attended and sang in as a child. It’s a nice place to spend an hour or two. Also, we were happy to add to our list of nice soft ice cream places. The “Dairy Kream” was busy any time we passed by. Our stay at Tupelo was a relaxing one and we thought our five nights there was about the right length of time for us to enjoy the area and take care of a few day to day things we needed to do.</p>

<p>I have heard so much about Liberty University I wanted to see it for myself.  The young man in the Visitors center was very friendly and helpful.  We walked to the DeMoss building that houses the current library in the bottom floor. The campus is beautiful and covers many acres. As we walked we noticed how clean cut the students were.  Several smiled and spoke as we passed.  The Lynchburg transit runs through campus and provides the students easy access to the various areas of the large campus.  The campus is about to get a beautiful new library so, while the old library continues to function I decided to pass on doing a blog about it. Two things that got our attention were the giant &#8220;LU&#8221; logo which takes up much of the side of the mountain above the campus and the Liberty Mountain Snowflex Center next to it.  The Snowflex is a snowless ski slope where students can go for the view, to ski, snowboard, or tube year around.  I think Liberty University is worth a visit if you happen to be in the area.</p>
<p>On Friday we decided to go to Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Popular Forest. He started building this place in 1806 as a retreat from his very pubic life.  It was privately owned by people outside the Jefferson family from early 1800s until it was acquired by a non-profit group in the early 1980s. The grounds are quiet and restful and tour was very informative.  We gained a different perspective on Thomas Jefferson and his life.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to see in this area that we hope to visit on a future trip to this area.</p>

<p>I talked to a fellow the other night who said he has been a member of Thousand Trails for several years but has never been to any other TT campground aside from this one: Chesapeake Bay. I think that if he’s going to settle for just one that he’s made a pretty good choice. This is a nice place that has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest draw here is the Piankatank River which borders the campground to the north. This is a big river, probably a mile wide at the campground as it nears the Chesapeake. The park’s marina is especially busy on weekends as people try their luck fishing or go for rides on speedboats or even go for a swim.</p>
<p>If river swimming isn’t for you, there are two nice pools plus a big sauna. There’s also a challenging mini-golf course. The tennis courts have been pretty much taken over by “Pickleball” players. We’ve seen this game being played elsewhere, but so far this feels the most like “pickleball central.” I won’t try to describe the game aside from saying it’s a cross between ping-pong and tennis and is way more active and challenging than you might think.</p>
<p>There are a lot of campsites here with both 50 and 30 amp sites available. I think all sites except maybe the tent only area provide sewer hookups. The sites are pretty level and provide a reasonable amount of space. If you want to have a view of the river during the busy summer season you’ll have to arrive mid-week. Also, there are a lot of seasonal residents here, but they seem to like E-loop which is across the lake from the rest of the campground.</p>
<p>We have been here through two weekends, including Labor Day weekend and the park has been quite busy with lots going on. The place is packed out for the holiday. In fact, there have been very few empty campsites through our entire stay.</p>
<p>There’s an active church group here. I think they are locals like the fellow I met the other day. They operate almost as an organized church – they even provided Vacation Bible School for the campground earlier this summer!</p>
<p>As you can tell, I like this campground that has so much going for it. A minor negative is that we’re a long way out in the country. The nearest Walmart is 15 miles to the south and the biggest local draw, Colonial Williamsburg, is around 40 miles distant. Then again, for most people, this is the destination rather than a place to stay while visiting the area.</p>
<p>When you come to Chesapeake Bay Thousand Trails be sure to visit the camp store and get an ice cream. Warning…you only want one “scoop.” The serving is huge and two of you might just want to split a single scoop!</p>
<p>If you are a member of Thousand Trails and looking for a place to camp in the Tidewater Region, look no farther: this is it!</p>

<p>Scott and I had a wonderful time at Colonial Williamsburg!  The first thing we did was tour the British Governor’s Palace with a docent.  It is luxurious and decorated fashionably according to 17th century England’s styles. I was surprised that the red and white slip covers on the chairs are consistent with high society in America’s colonial days.  When I asked about it I was told that they were used to protect the seat covers from fly spots.  When a person desired to use a chair a nearby servant would quickly remove the cover.</p>
<p>There were many people dressed in colonial style and were willing to talk with us about their trade.  We met a gardener, silversmith, a milliner and others.  I really enjoyed seeing the simple dresses along with a very dressy dress in the milliner’s shop which also stocked thread and fabric for those who desired to sew for themselves.</p>
<p>We enjoyed seeing a short movie about Martha Washington and how the war affected her.  Following the movie a very accomplished actress came on stage as America’s “first” First Lady.  For nearly an hour she talked about “her” life.  She described her joining General Washington at various camps and how she gave up wearing her British silk dresses and wore “colonial” clothes.  She spoke of how she and other officers’ wives mended clothes and knitted socks for the soldiers.  She also told of how her son died of camp fever.</p>
<p>Later on we heard a Black slave preacher called Moses preach and pray for the colonial soldiers.  He had an exchange with a member of the local militia and also a chaplain from the local colonial militia.   The spiritual element was very strong and we were reminded of the faith of our national forbearers.</p>
<p>The last house we toured was the Randolph Peyton House.  It’s a big place — painted a deep red. The oldest part of the building was constructed in 1715.  The house has been added onto several times and various out buildings such were added through the years.  We entered through a side door into the oldest part of the house and were directed on a tour through the house, seeing the Mr. Peyton’s office and various other rooms. I was impressed by the trunks that were stored in one room.  They were antiques even when the house was new, dating back into the 1600’s.</p>
<p>We concluded our visit to Colonial Williamsburg by watching a great presentation of the Fife and Drum Corps and a review of the troops by General Washington on his white horse. Following the review there was a demonstration of shooting loading and firing rifles, use of bayonets and then, the very loud and impressive firing of the cannons.</p>
<p>The other highlight of our time here was a visit to Yorktown.  We began our visit at the Yorktown National Park Visitor center where we watched and introductory film that helped us understand the driving tour.  We were surprised to see how close the two armies actually were as they prepared for to do battle.  The fact that Washington was able to march his forces, build the redoubts and do battle show determination and stamina on the part of the Colonials.  Of course, having the French fleet hold off the British Navy was a turning point, contributing to Cornwallis’ inability to retreat across the York River to Gloucester.</p>
<p>During the driving tour we saw the restored Moore House where the terms for the surrender of Yorktown were worked out.  It’s a lovely home originally on 500 acres with a view of the York River.</p>
<p>Finishing our trip we rode the free trolley from the NPS visitors center to Yorktown and walked along Water Street by the River then took the trolley back.</p>

<p>On Saturday of our stay at Front Royal we drove about an hour to the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy National Air And Space Museum near Dulles Airport, Washington, DC.  The museum is a large hanger with an impressive front on it.  The first thing we did as take the free Highlights tour which lasted about 90 minutes.  It was well worth the time and we highly recommend it.  Our docent took us in chronological order starting with early winged flight.  We saw originals that are preserved, replicas made up of several planes, and some planes that are in the process of being restored.  One of the restoration projects is from WWI.  It has the original cloth wings and even has marks where it was hit by bullets — amazing!  We saw spy planes, as well as many military planes,crop dusters, racing planes and even the baskets from several hot air balloons. I enjoyed seeing the Spirit of Columbus, a Cessna 180 flown around the world in by Jerrie Mock in 1964. The final and best stop of our tour was the Space Shuttle Discovery. It has been left as it was upon completion of it’s final journey into space: somewhat dirty and “bruised” and, of course, awesome to see.</p>
<p>Our day at Shenandoah National Park driving Skyline Drive was a fun day trip.  We drove down a state highway south around 60 miles and then entered the park to travel the two lane twisting Skyline Drive back to Front Royal. The views are amazing all the way along. There are many pull offs where one can absorb the views and take lots of photographs.  There are welcome areas with restaurants with gift shops along the way but we opted to pack a lunch and eat at one of the overlooks.  We were lucky enough to see a few deer and actually saw a black bear.  By the time we could get turned around in hopes of getting a better look the bear had moved back into the trees. Scott just loved the drive and I agree that it is a great way to spend a day.</p>
<p>Being in this historic area I had to visit a little of the Civil War History.  There’s a full driving tour but we chose to see a very small portion. We saw the cottage of Belle Boyd who was a Confederate spy, Williams Chapel CME which was finished in 1845, and the home of a young woman named Lucy Buck who daughter of a prosperous planter and kept a diary throughout the Civil War.  We also visited Prospect Hill Cemetery where in 1882 the remains of 276 soldiers of the former Confederacy are interred. Ninety of the soldiers are identified and buried in a circle and the others are buried in a common grave in the center where an 18 foot high monument is erected above them.  The cemetery is a sobering reminder of the tragedy of war.</p>
<p>Our stay in this area has been quite enjoyable stay and we recommend it for both it’s scenery and it’s history.</p>

<p>We had heard much about this area and were excited to arrive at our Thousand Trails campground near Hershey.</p>
<p>Our first excursion took us to the area east of Lancaster.  This is Amish country and there are mile after mile of beautiful farms.  The town of Intercourse is surrounded by those farms and is filled with nice commercial shops.  We listened to a three piece band and checked out the shops. I especially enjoyed the Candle Barn there.  Scott liked the pickle factory with all the free samples of everything from pickles (of course) to apple butter.</p>
<p>Just down the road from Intercourse is Bird-in-hand.  There’s a very nice farmer’s market there that we enjoyed very much. There were jams, jellies, sweets, meats, cheeses, baked goods, postcards, knick knacks, and leather goods.  We bought some sausage sticks, Amish butter cheese and dried tomato bread and had an impromptu and delicious picnic.</p>
<p>The Amish farms feature impressive barns and often the road runs within just a couple of feet of the front door of the barn.  I wasn’t aware that so much corn is grown in Pennsylvania but it is everywhere.  As we drove through the area we saw many Amish families working, including a man a boy and a young man cutting and staking tobacco.  There were also several girls/ young women using manual push mowers to mow their lawns.</p>
<p>Later in our stay we went out to eat at a highly recommended Amish restaurant in Ronks PA called Dienner’s for buffet lunch. It was really good — especially the desserts.  On the way home we drove to Lititz, PA and toured the Julius Sturgis pretzel bakery.  They gave lessons teaching us how to hand twist pretzels.  We also learned a bit of pretzel history.  At first the only pretzels were soft pretzels.  Then, because of some batches being accidentally baked twice hard pretzels were created.  Julius liked the taste so he started making them commercially.  We saw original equipment and ovens and one of automated pretzel twisting machines.   At the end of the tour everyone was given a free bag of hard pretzels.  We also purchased some hand made soft pretzels that were made right there.  It was a nice stop and we thought it was well worth the $3.00 for the tour.</p>
<p>Of course, a highlight of this stay was our visit to Hershey Chocolate World.  The free tour/ride was cute and it explained how chocolate is picked, processed and made into Hershey candy.  There’s even a free snack size bar at end of the ride!  We purchased tickets for the trolley tour and a chocolate tasting experience.  The trolley took us on an entertaining and informative history of Milton Hershey: his factory and school.  We were sitting near the back of the trolley and had a bit of trouble hearing and understanding the skits.</p>
<p>The Tasting Experience was nice.  We learned the history of the use of chocolate and how cocoa beans draw flavor from plants and flowers nearby. We tasted 5 different snack bars and learned how they were different. Then we got a free regular size Hershey bar as we left.  Hershey’s Chocolate World features a large gift shop filled with all things chocolate!  It was fun and very tempting!</p>
<p>The other highlight of our stay was our visit to Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.  It’s hard to express how it felt to actually see the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  We learned the history of the Liberty Bell as we waited in line to see it.  This bell symbolizes a great deal to our nation and to those who love liberty around the world.  After seeing the liberty bell we went back to the visitors center and watched two excellent free movies before touring Independence Hall.  One film is based on the journals of several young adults who lived through the American Revolution.  It told how their lives were shaped and often changed by their decisions at that time.  The other movie used quotes of our founding Fathers and told some of what they went through to write and proclaim our Independence.</p>
<p>Seeing Independence Hall and knowing the founding Fathers and citizens of that day actually sat in those rooms, discussing, debating, and signing the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution is amazing.   I’m so glad I was able to experience this and hope our grandchildren get the opportunity visit this inspirational place soon.</p>
<p>Scott’s sister, Susan spent a week of our stay at Hershey with us and we enjoyed her company very much.  Her and I tried to visit the Thousand Trails campground mini-golf course every day.  It was fun but I don’t think either of us has a future as professional golfers!  Seriously, we’re so glad Susan came to see us.  Having her to share all our fun here made it all even more enjoyable.</p>
