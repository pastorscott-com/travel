										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use Google maps a lot for planning. I mostly use it for routing. Sometimes if I&#8217;m unsure of a section of highway (or want to check out the campground entrance) I check out the street view and virtually drive along a section of highway to see what it looks like. <a href="http://www.brianfolts.com/driver/">Here&#8217;s a nifty website</a> that automates journeying the street view.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m in unfamiliar country and concerned about taking the 5th wheel over a highway I&#8217;ll go to Google Earth view and zoom in close enough to see what kind of vehicles are on that road. If I see a few 18 wheelers or campers I know I can drive it too.</p>
<p>Recently, just for fun I was looking at San Jacinto Monument (and Battleship Texas) where we volunteered last winter and will return to in less than a month. I was surprised to see that sometime during our stay there last winter the area was photographed by Google Earth and our camper was photographed from far above. Cool, huh!</p>
