We went to the Banana Pudding Festival at Centerville,TN.  It&#8217;s a fun event offering various craft and food booths. We bought a plate of twisted fried potatoes that was more than we could eat.  Then we went to the Banana Tasting tent and purchased our eight small tastings of pudding. They were all good but two were unique. One was made with Twinkies another had peanut butter in it.  My favorite was a traditional one made by a local church. There were large jars for people to put money into to &#8220;vote&#8221; for their favorite banana pudding. All the money goes to charity.  It was very warm so we did not go to the antique car show going on in town or visit the craft booths set up all around the courthouse on the square.</p>
<p>As you can tell we enjoyed our time along Natchez Trace Parkway in south-central Tennessee.  There&#8217;s a lot to see and do in the area, especially for those who like the outdoors or like crafts.</p>
