Several years ago Jackie and I were invited to the home of some friends with a strong Oriental connection. When we arrived our host invited us to the table where we visited while he made us some hot tea. He commented that the making and drinking of tea was a part of the Oriental culture. That ritual came to mind these past few days as I’ve offered folks a cup of coffee. Normally I put some coffee and water into the coffee maker, press the “go” button and within a few minutes I have some good hot coffee. Living in these non-electric conditions makes the “cup of coffee” experience a bit more complicated. I have to pump up the camp stove and light it. I have to put water and coffee in our old fashioned coffee pot, and then wait for the water to start boiling and then percolating. Whenever I decide the color of the coffee in the little glass top is dark enough I can pour the coffee, but it is way too hot to drink having just come off of a rolling boil. Through all of this, there is time to chat. In this case the conversation is about the storm and the clean up and what stores are open. Anyway, it’s a bit of a throwback to simpler, slower-paced times.</p>
