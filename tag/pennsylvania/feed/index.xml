<p>Our 2019 Adventure was our first year in our <a href="/2019/01/16/2019-motorhome-owners/">2005 Safari Cheetah</a> diesel pusher motorhome. Traveling in the motorhome as opposed to the 5th wheel presented a <a href="/2019/08/25/comparing-a-5th-wheel-and-a-diesel-pusher-motorhome/">bit of a learning curve for us</a>. We got the Cheetah in January and put a lot of effort getting comfortable on the &#8220;camper side&#8221; of the rig. However, when we started traveling in April (and in spite of our having taken a few shake down cruises in it) we began finding mechanical issues that needed attention. Not only that, but we had a few mishaps that added to the list of needed fixes. We worked our way through them as we traveled and finally felt we had resolved most of problems.</p>
<p>Over all we drove the motorhome just over 4200 miles, visiting 31 campgrounds in 17 states. Our longest move day was 305 miles but our average move was just 136 miles.</p>
<p>Our winter stay was a bit longer than usual. Our year started and ended at <a href="/2019/04/13/2019-green-caye-rv-park-dickinson-texas/">Green Caye RV Park</a> in Dickinson, Texas – 150 days total for the year. This isn&#8217;t anything close to being our favorite park, but it is near friends and family (and doctors) so it is a reasonable winter landing spot for us.</p>
<p>Our <a href="/tag/thousand-trails/">Thousand Trails</a> membership continues to be a good investment for us. This year we spent 154 nights at Thousand Trails campgrounds in six states.</p>
<p>Our favorite campgrounds, though, remain <a href="/tag/army-corps-of-engineers/">Corps of Engineers</a> campgrounds. Our America the Beautiful pass makes these great campgrounds a real bargain for us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft " src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-24zyYAiBtL4/XfUpmCve0aI/AAAAAAABDBk/mwwNQUO6qTwlCmHLdEkTVJR4my-hfEnNgCKgBGAsYHg/s1600/IMG_20190724_151016.jpg" width="247" height="139" />One of the highlights of the year for us was having our family join us at <a href="/2019/07/31/2019-hershey-thousand-trails-lebanon-pa/">Hershey, PA Thousand Trails</a>. We had a great time visiting all the sights of the Hershey-Lancaster-Gettysburg area. It was especially fun sharing with them some of our <a href="/2019/07/31/2019-sightseeing-lancaster-hershey-pa/">favorite attractions</a> in the area – places like Jiggers in Mt Gretna and the Bird In Hand Farmer&#8217;s Market.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright " src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-044aPBslPl0/XfUqSleJWGI/AAAAAAABDBs/8w9CnXXiQr0xeCqA9_WJgFEmAn7kb0NQQCKgBGAsYHg/s1600/IMG_20190815_195900_DRO.jpg" width="226" height="131" />The other highlight of our year was celebrating our 50th Wedding Anniversary at <a href="/2019/08/17/2019-sightseeing-niagara-falls-and-vicinity/">Niagara Falls.</a>  We celebrated all week, exploring the area everywhere from the beautiful Gorge to taking a boat ride through locks on the Erie Canal.  We saved our day at the Falls for the actual date of our anniversary and then went out for an excellent meal after a busy day at the Falls.</p>
<p>In a couple of weeks I&#8217;ll finish the year with an <a href="/2020/01/01/annual-expenditures-wrapup/">expense report</a> – admittedly, it has been a pretty expensive year. Still, as you can see, we got a lot of bang for our buck!</p>
