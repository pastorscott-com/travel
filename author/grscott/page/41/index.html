<p>I have heard so much about Liberty University I wanted to see it for myself.  The young man in the Visitors center was very friendly and helpful.  We walked to the DeMoss building that houses the current library in the bottom floor. The campus is beautiful and covers many acres. As we walked we noticed how clean cut the students were.  Several smiled and spoke as we passed.  The Lynchburg transit runs through campus and provides the students easy access to the various areas of the large campus.  The campus is about to get a beautiful new library so, while the old library continues to function I decided to pass on doing a blog about it. Two things that got our attention were the giant &#8220;LU&#8221; logo which takes up much of the side of the mountain above the campus and the Liberty Mountain Snowflex Center next to it.  The Snowflex is a snowless ski slope where students can go for the view, to ski, snowboard, or tube year around.  I think Liberty University is worth a visit if you happen to be in the area.</p>
<p>On Friday we decided to go to Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Popular Forest. He started building this place in 1806 as a retreat from his very pubic life.  It was privately owned by people outside the Jefferson family from early 1800s until it was acquired by a non-profit group in the early 1980s. The grounds are quiet and restful and tour was very informative.  We gained a different perspective on Thomas Jefferson and his life.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to see in this area that we hope to visit on a future trip to this area.</p>

<p>There are several interesting places to visit in the area.  Jackie will do a post on Appomattox, Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Poplar Forest, and the like.  These places are all within 45 minutes of the campground.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve enjoyed the full hookup site (30 amp electric) and excellent 4G cell data.  We are on C-Loop, apparently preferred by the seasonal residents.  However, the other side of the park looks just as nice and is closer to the pool and main activity center.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you what this park is like during the summer.  My guess is that its busy with lots of stuff going on.  I can tell you that here in the first week of &#8220;off season&#8221; that it&#8217;s been quiet and beautiful &#8212; a good peaceful, relaxing week.</p>

<p>I talked to a fellow the other night who said he has been a member of Thousand Trails for several years but has never been to any other TT campground aside from this one: Chesapeake Bay. I think that if he’s going to settle for just one that he’s made a pretty good choice. This is a nice place that has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest draw here is the Piankatank River which borders the campground to the north. This is a big river, probably a mile wide at the campground as it nears the Chesapeake. The park’s marina is especially busy on weekends as people try their luck fishing or go for rides on speedboats or even go for a swim.</p>
<p>If river swimming isn’t for you, there are two nice pools plus a big sauna. There’s also a challenging mini-golf course. The tennis courts have been pretty much taken over by “Pickleball” players. We’ve seen this game being played elsewhere, but so far this feels the most like “pickleball central.” I won’t try to describe the game aside from saying it’s a cross between ping-pong and tennis and is way more active and challenging than you might think.</p>
<p>There are a lot of campsites here with both 50 and 30 amp sites available. I think all sites except maybe the tent only area provide sewer hookups. The sites are pretty level and provide a reasonable amount of space. If you want to have a view of the river during the busy summer season you’ll have to arrive mid-week. Also, there are a lot of seasonal residents here, but they seem to like E-loop which is across the lake from the rest of the campground.</p>
<p>We have been here through two weekends, including Labor Day weekend and the park has been quite busy with lots going on. The place is packed out for the holiday. In fact, there have been very few empty campsites through our entire stay.</p>
<p>There’s an active church group here. I think they are locals like the fellow I met the other day. They operate almost as an organized church – they even provided Vacation Bible School for the campground earlier this summer!</p>
<p>As you can tell, I like this campground that has so much going for it. A minor negative is that we’re a long way out in the country. The nearest Walmart is 15 miles to the south and the biggest local draw, Colonial Williamsburg, is around 40 miles distant. Then again, for most people, this is the destination rather than a place to stay while visiting the area.</p>
<p>When you come to Chesapeake Bay Thousand Trails be sure to visit the camp store and get an ice cream. Warning…you only want one “scoop.” The serving is huge and two of you might just want to split a single scoop!</p>
<p>If you are a member of Thousand Trails and looking for a place to camp in the Tidewater Region, look no farther: this is it!</p>

<p>Scott and I had a wonderful time at Colonial Williamsburg!  The first thing we did was tour the British Governor’s Palace with a docent.  It is luxurious and decorated fashionably according to 17th century England’s styles. I was surprised that the red and white slip covers on the chairs are consistent with high society in America’s colonial days.  When I asked about it I was told that they were used to protect the seat covers from fly spots.  When a person desired to use a chair a nearby servant would quickly remove the cover.</p>
<p>There were many people dressed in colonial style and were willing to talk with us about their trade.  We met a gardener, silversmith, a milliner and others.  I really enjoyed seeing the simple dresses along with a very dressy dress in the milliner’s shop which also stocked thread and fabric for those who desired to sew for themselves.</p>
<p>We enjoyed seeing a short movie about Martha Washington and how the war affected her.  Following the movie a very accomplished actress came on stage as America’s “first” First Lady.  For nearly an hour she talked about “her” life.  She described her joining General Washington at various camps and how she gave up wearing her British silk dresses and wore “colonial” clothes.  She spoke of how she and other officers’ wives mended clothes and knitted socks for the soldiers.  She also told of how her son died of camp fever.</p>
<p>Later on we heard a Black slave preacher called Moses preach and pray for the colonial soldiers.  He had an exchange with a member of the local militia and also a chaplain from the local colonial militia.   The spiritual element was very strong and we were reminded of the faith of our national forbearers.</p>
<p>The last house we toured was the Randolph Peyton House.  It’s a big place — painted a deep red. The oldest part of the building was constructed in 1715.  The house has been added onto several times and various out buildings such were added through the years.  We entered through a side door into the oldest part of the house and were directed on a tour through the house, seeing the Mr. Peyton’s office and various other rooms. I was impressed by the trunks that were stored in one room.  They were antiques even when the house was new, dating back into the 1600’s.</p>
<p>We concluded our visit to Colonial Williamsburg by watching a great presentation of the Fife and Drum Corps and a review of the troops by General Washington on his white horse. Following the review there was a demonstration of shooting loading and firing rifles, use of bayonets and then, the very loud and impressive firing of the cannons.</p>
<p>The other highlight of our time here was a visit to Yorktown.  We began our visit at the Yorktown National Park Visitor center where we watched and introductory film that helped us understand the driving tour.  We were surprised to see how close the two armies actually were as they prepared for to do battle.  The fact that Washington was able to march his forces, build the redoubts and do battle show determination and stamina on the part of the Colonials.  Of course, having the French fleet hold off the British Navy was a turning point, contributing to Cornwallis’ inability to retreat across the York River to Gloucester.</p>
<p>During the driving tour we saw the restored Moore House where the terms for the surrender of Yorktown were worked out.  It’s a lovely home originally on 500 acres with a view of the York River.</p>
<p>Finishing our trip we rode the free trolley from the NPS visitors center to Yorktown and walked along Water Street by the River then took the trolley back.</p>

		<p>As we began planning our transition from a “stix and brix” lifestyle to being retired full time RVers I did considerable research on everything from budgets to campgrounds to RV upgrades.  I searched the internet for information and, happily, found quite a bit.</p>
<p>I gleaned a lot of specific information from people’s blogs.  If you aren’t comfortable searching Google you are missing out.  I was especially helped by several people who posted their expenditures information.  It is because of their willingness to open the door a bit to their personal lives that we’ve been willing to share a bit of ours.</p>
<p>There are several RV forums that contain a wealth of information.  However, in my opinion there is none better on this topic than one provided by Escapees.  Escapees is a camping club specifically for full time RVers.  I spent hours reading old threads and then began asking questions of my own.  I gleaned a ton of information there and still read the posts there every day.</p>
<p>John and Kathy Huggins of Living the RV Dream are another great resource.  Their weekly podcast is positive and informative.  They have written a book about full time RVing named “So, You Want to be a Full-Time RVer?” (paperback or ebook) that I recommend.</p>
<p>Facebook has a great deal of full time RVing information.  There’s a Living the RV Dream group, a Full Time RVers group, and probably another 20 groups that provide support for this lifestyle.</p>
<p>When one is planning exactly where to camp, a terrific resource is RVParkReviews.com.  You’ll find lots of information on campgrounds across the country.  We spend a lot of time in Thousand Trails preserves and, in addition to RVParkReviews, we get a lot of campground information from the Thousand Trails unofficial Facebook group.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, I hope you’ll consider this Here and There blog and it’s Facebook page as a good resource for campground reviews, sightseeing information, and all things related to full time RVing.  As I’ve researched potential campgrounds I’ve often been frustrated that the only photos I can find are either “glamor shots” posted by the campground itself or people’s photos of their kids or pets, etc. at the campground.  I have nothing against such photos, but I want to see some candid photos of the campsites and facilities.  I’m focusing on those sort or photos for this blog while Jackie focuses on where we went and what we saw while at that campground.</p>
<p>As it is when one is trying to thank everyone for their support in winning some reward, I know this post leaves out some great resources on full time RVing.  In fact, I started out to name just a couple and have had trouble finding an off ramp.  Still, the resources I’ve named here are my primary ones and I hope you find them helpful.</p>

<p>On Saturday of our stay at Front Royal we drove about an hour to the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy National Air And Space Museum near Dulles Airport, Washington, DC.  The museum is a large hanger with an impressive front on it.  The first thing we did as take the free Highlights tour which lasted about 90 minutes.  It was well worth the time and we highly recommend it.  Our docent took us in chronological order starting with early winged flight.  We saw originals that are preserved, replicas made up of several planes, and some planes that are in the process of being restored.  One of the restoration projects is from WWI.  It has the original cloth wings and even has marks where it was hit by bullets — amazing!  We saw spy planes, as well as many military planes,crop dusters, racing planes and even the baskets from several hot air balloons. I enjoyed seeing the Spirit of Columbus, a Cessna 180 flown around the world in by Jerrie Mock in 1964. The final and best stop of our tour was the Space Shuttle Discovery. It has been left as it was upon completion of it’s final journey into space: somewhat dirty and “bruised” and, of course, awesome to see.</p>
<p>Our day at Shenandoah National Park driving Skyline Drive was a fun day trip.  We drove down a state highway south around 60 miles and then entered the park to travel the two lane twisting Skyline Drive back to Front Royal. The views are amazing all the way along. There are many pull offs where one can absorb the views and take lots of photographs.  There are welcome areas with restaurants with gift shops along the way but we opted to pack a lunch and eat at one of the overlooks.  We were lucky enough to see a few deer and actually saw a black bear.  By the time we could get turned around in hopes of getting a better look the bear had moved back into the trees. Scott just loved the drive and I agree that it is a great way to spend a day.</p>
<p>Being in this historic area I had to visit a little of the Civil War History.  There’s a full driving tour but we chose to see a very small portion. We saw the cottage of Belle Boyd who was a Confederate spy, Williams Chapel CME which was finished in 1845, and the home of a young woman named Lucy Buck who daughter of a prosperous planter and kept a diary throughout the Civil War.  We also visited Prospect Hill Cemetery where in 1882 the remains of 276 soldiers of the former Confederacy are interred. Ninety of the soldiers are identified and buried in a circle and the others are buried in a common grave in the center where an 18 foot high monument is erected above them.  The cemetery is a sobering reminder of the tragedy of war.</p>
<p>Our stay in this area has been quite enjoyable stay and we recommend it for both it’s scenery and it’s history.</p>

<p>Our journey down interstate 81 included miles driven in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia.  That sounds impressive but really, it was only a 3 hour or so trip.  The drive was an easy one without any traffic to speak of and no big hills to pull.  By early afternoon we had arrived at Skyline Ranch Resort near Front Royal, Virginia.</p>
<p>There are several nice features here: a nice activity center, a big pool, a nifty mini-golf course, a min-chapel that hosts regular church services, and several activities scheduled for the weekend.  We&#8217;re literally 10 minutes from Skyline Drive and Shenandoah National Park and about an hour from Washington DC.  There&#8217;s strong WiFi but it&#8217;s $3 a day.  I&#8217;ve opted to stay on my Verizon hotspot even though it&#8217;s a weak 3G.</p>
<p>If I return here I think I&#8217;ll lobby more strongly for a site with a bit of shade, 50 amps or not.  I&#8217;ll also mention that several reviews of this place reported stinky water. <em>(update: according to a comment from the campground the water system has now been upgraded)</em>  We haven&#8217;t found that however my external water filter is now very dirty and needing to be changed after just a few nights here.</p>
<p>With the unexpected fees, the field parking spot, and the dirty water balanced by nice amenities and a pretty good location, I&#8217;d give this place a score of 6 or 7 out of 10.</p>

<p>We had heard much about this area and were excited to arrive at our Thousand Trails campground near Hershey.</p>
<p>Our first excursion took us to the area east of Lancaster.  This is Amish country and there are mile after mile of beautiful farms.  The town of Intercourse is surrounded by those farms and is filled with nice commercial shops.  We listened to a three piece band and checked out the shops. I especially enjoyed the Candle Barn there.  Scott liked the pickle factory with all the free samples of everything from pickles (of course) to apple butter.</p>
<p>Just down the road from Intercourse is Bird-in-hand.  There’s a very nice farmer’s market there that we enjoyed very much. There were jams, jellies, sweets, meats, cheeses, baked goods, postcards, knick knacks, and leather goods.  We bought some sausage sticks, Amish butter cheese and dried tomato bread and had an impromptu and delicious picnic.</p>
<p>The Amish farms feature impressive barns and often the road runs within just a couple of feet of the front door of the barn.  I wasn’t aware that so much corn is grown in Pennsylvania but it is everywhere.  As we drove through the area we saw many Amish families working, including a man a boy and a young man cutting and staking tobacco.  There were also several girls/ young women using manual push mowers to mow their lawns.</p>
<p>Later in our stay we went out to eat at a highly recommended Amish restaurant in Ronks PA called Dienner’s for buffet lunch. It was really good — especially the desserts.  On the way home we drove to Lititz, PA and toured the Julius Sturgis pretzel bakery.  They gave lessons teaching us how to hand twist pretzels.  We also learned a bit of pretzel history.  At first the only pretzels were soft pretzels.  Then, because of some batches being accidentally baked twice hard pretzels were created.  Julius liked the taste so he started making them commercially.  We saw original equipment and ovens and one of automated pretzel twisting machines.   At the end of the tour everyone was given a free bag of hard pretzels.  We also purchased some hand made soft pretzels that were made right there.  It was a nice stop and we thought it was well worth the $3.00 for the tour.</p>
<p>Of course, a highlight of this stay was our visit to Hershey Chocolate World.  The free tour/ride was cute and it explained how chocolate is picked, processed and made into Hershey candy.  There’s even a free snack size bar at end of the ride!  We purchased tickets for the trolley tour and a chocolate tasting experience.  The trolley took us on an entertaining and informative history of Milton Hershey: his factory and school.  We were sitting near the back of the trolley and had a bit of trouble hearing and understanding the skits.</p>
<p>The Tasting Experience was nice.  We learned the history of the use of chocolate and how cocoa beans draw flavor from plants and flowers nearby. We tasted 5 different snack bars and learned how they were different. Then we got a free regular size Hershey bar as we left.  Hershey’s Chocolate World features a large gift shop filled with all things chocolate!  It was fun and very tempting!</p>
<p>The other highlight of our stay was our visit to Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.  It’s hard to express how it felt to actually see the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.  We learned the history of the Liberty Bell as we waited in line to see it.  This bell symbolizes a great deal to our nation and to those who love liberty around the world.  After seeing the liberty bell we went back to the visitors center and watched two excellent free movies before touring Independence Hall.  One film is based on the journals of several young adults who lived through the American Revolution.  It told how their lives were shaped and often changed by their decisions at that time.  The other movie used quotes of our founding Fathers and told some of what they went through to write and proclaim our Independence.</p>
<p>Seeing Independence Hall and knowing the founding Fathers and citizens of that day actually sat in those rooms, discussing, debating, and signing the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution is amazing.   I’m so glad I was able to experience this and hope our grandchildren get the opportunity visit this inspirational place soon.</p>
<p>Scott’s sister, Susan spent a week of our stay at Hershey with us and we enjoyed her company very much.  Her and I tried to visit the Thousand Trails campground mini-golf course every day.  It was fun but I don’t think either of us has a future as professional golfers!  Seriously, we’re so glad Susan came to see us.  Having her to share all our fun here made it all even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Our drive down PA Hwy 15 from the New York State Line south was very pretty.  The mountains are green and impressive.  I admit I didn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as I should have because I was anxiously watching the heat gauge on the F350.  The grades aren&#8217;t as steep as they are long and long pulls have been the trigger for some overheating.  However, the repairs done in western New York did the trick.  The temperature gauge never wiggled above normal.  I think I can declare victory on that one.</p>
<p>Later in the journey we drove for many miles along the Susquehanna River.  Again, it was a gorgeous drive.  I highly recommend the route we took for it&#8217;s scenic beauty.</p>
<p>The campground has a large outside pool and an inside adults-only spa.  There&#8217;s a well stocked camp store, a nifty (and challenging) mini-golf course, horseshoe pits, and tennis courts.  Several people meet at the courts each morning to play pickleball &#8211; a game that&#8217;s a cross between tennis and ping pong.  It looks like a lot of fun but I haven&#8217;t tried it out.</p>
<p>Hershey, PA is famous for, of course, chocolate.  We enjoyed a visit to the chocolate-related attractions there as well as to Amish country and much more.  Jackie will blog about these things shortly.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve enjoyed having my sister, Susan, come in for a week&#8217;s visit.  She&#8217;s good company for us and I think she&#8217;s had a good time checking out the area with us.  Our stay at Hershey is our longest scheduled stop of summer 2013.  We&#8217;re here a full two weeks.  We&#8217;ve been in other places that were good for about a week&#8217;s stay, but Hershey Thousand Trails is well worth the full two weeks.</p>

<p>We arrived at Tompkins Campground which is part of the Army Corps of Engineers’ Cowanesque Lake Facility near Lawrenceville, PA on a Thursday afternoon.  The campsites are just great: roomy, paved, and easy to back a camper in to.  We enjoyed having such an easy arrival and were quickly settled in.</p>
<p>On Friday we drove to Watkins Glen State Park.  Along the way we enjoyed the lovely countryside.  In town we stopped to pick up a sandwich to eat on the hike, found a parking lot for the truck and walked to the park. Knowing it was going to be a fairly strenuous hike down the gorge we opted to pay for the shuttle and hike back down to town.  Judging by the look on the faces of several who opted to hike up rather than down I think we made a good choice.  Even with walking sticks and hiking down hill it was plenty steep for me.  Since we started at the top we immediately went down about 180 or so steps down into the gorge and to the trail by the river.  The railroad trestle behind and above us was very imposing.  We followed the smooth rock trail that was built by the CCC many years ago.  Along the way the trail has tunnels and a winding staircase. The river was quite impressive with the falls becoming larger.  At one point the trail even took us behind a waterfall. There are many photogenic spots and we enjoyed each one.  With so many other people on the trail going both directions and I felt like we were swept along when sometimes I would  like to have stopped and spent some time just enjoying the view without the constant parade of people.</p>
<p>A couple of days later we visited Corning Museum of Glass.  It is well worth the trip and I am glad we took the free tour with the docent.  This gave us highlights of the museum such as the Tiffany glass wall and why it looks three dimensional.   We saw ancient glass that has been excavated as well products like the lens used in the Palomar observatory In California and windows used by NASA, along with stories about many other exhibits. The tour ended with a free glass blowing demonstration with on going explanation of what was happening.  We went back to spend more time in areas we found interesting during the tour.  There is also a gift shop and cafe at the museum.</p>
<p>Another highlight from the area is the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon.  This is a beautiful place for a day trip from where we were staying.  It was a scenic drive and we enjoyed looking at the historic houses and buildings  in the towns.  We did the mile and a half rim tour which was rather steep.  The view of the river below was beautiful. The bike trail down through the canyon was tempting.  It’s part of the “rails to trails” projects that are happening across the country where old rail lines are being removed and transformed into wonderful bike trails.  We would have loved to ride the bike trail but we knew it would be too much for us.  We enjoyed walking in the woods and hearing the sounds of nature. This area was developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and there is a statue in honor of these men.</p>
<p>Scott and I have enjoyed this beautiful New York/Pennsylvania stay and recommend it to all who love the beauty of nature.</p>
